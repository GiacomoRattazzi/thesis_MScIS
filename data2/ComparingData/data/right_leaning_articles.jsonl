{"headline": "the prince of wales's ladybird book on climate change is not a spoof, unfortunately", "body": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nThe Prince of Wales is going to write a Ladybird book about the perils of climate change.\nWhen I first read the headline on Twitter I thought this sounded like a perfectly splendid and hilarious idea \u2013 albeit a slightly cruel joke at the hapless Prince\u2019s expense.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nLadybird has been doing a lot of ironic, spoof texts for adults, recently, with comical titles like The Ladybird Book of the Hangover; Five Go On A Strategy Away Day; The Midlife Crisis; the Ladybird book of the Zombie Apocalypse; and The Hipster.\nA book on Climate Change by a pampered, deluded prince who has a valet to squeeze his toothpaste onto his toothbrush, drives a bio-fuel-powered Aston Martin and who predicted more than a 100 months ago that we had just 100 months left to save the world from ManBearPig sounded to me like a perfect fit for the series.\nPerhaps I ought first to explain for the benefit of non-British readers what a Ladybird book is and why it occupies such an important place in our national psyche. Essentially it\u2019s our literary equivalent of Sesame Street: Ladybird books taught many of us to read.\nI myself learned to read using the Peter and Jane Ladybird series. Peter and Jane were the products of a wholesome pre-feminism-style nuclear family: Mum did the housework and shopping; Dad went out to work and even possibly smoked a pipe and had his supper waiting for him when he got home. They had a dog called Pat. See the dog. The dog likes the bone. Pat likes the bone. Pat is the dog. Something like that.\nAfter Peter and Jane you would graduate to the more generalist Ladybird easy-reading books, with titles like The Soldier (part of the People at Work series), The Elves and the Shoemaker (Well-loved Tales series), The Story of Railways (a Ladybird \u2018Achievements\u2019 book), Warwick the Kingmaker (from the Adventure from History series) and so on.\nAnyone in Britain aged from about 35 upwards remembers these classics very fondly and was very sad when the series more or less petered out in the Nineties and Noughties.\nBut then came the Ironic Revival.\nIt started with We Go To The Gallery \u2013 a series of illustrations by painter Miriam Elia in which Peter and Jane try to make sense of modern art. This ended in disaster for Elia who was brutally squished by the publisher\u2019s copyright lawyers.\nMeanwhile, on the internet, various spoof Ladybird covers appeared, among them My First Joint, The Story of Gay and The Ladybird Book of Hallucinogenic Drugs.\nThen Penguin the publisher which owns the Ladybird imprint got in on the act by producing its own pastiche series called Ladybird for Grown Ups, in which comedy scriptwriting duo (Paddington) Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris , devised silly new stories to accompany the original Ladybird artwork.\nHere is an extract from their book on The Husband:\nHow It Works: The Husband\nHe can remember football scores, all his old car number plates and most of the film Withnail And I. But he cannot remember what his wife asked him to bring back from the shops. This is because his brain is full up, not because he was not listening.\nThe series has been a massive publishing success, having sold 3.5 million copies since 2015. The Prince of Wales\u2019s book on Climate Change \u2013 unwittingly sending up the absurdity of the dwindling band of deluded dweebs who imagine that man-made global warming represents any kind of plausible problem \u2013 would have been a perfect fit.\nBut no. Turns out that Penguin actually mean us to take the Prince of Wales\u2019s drivel \u2013 co-written with Tony Juniper (formerly head of the hard-left pressure group Friends of the Earth) and Emily Shuckburgh (a scientist wheeled out to promote climate change at every opportunity because she\u2019s at Cambridge and she\u2019s hot) \u2013 seriously.\nWe know it\u2019s drivel because the cover art is a watercolour reproduction of a news photo from October 2000 showing an emergency team in a rubber boat rescuing people from a flooded English high street. Since there is very little evidence that any of Britain\u2019s floods are the result of climate change \u2013 rather than, say, part of the ebb and flow of natural weather patterns, probably exacerbated by things like EU environmental policy preventing the maintenance of rivers and actively promoting flood plains \u2013 it seems a jolly dishonest way to promote a supposedly serious science book for adults.\nEspecially one which, according to the publisher, has been \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d by \u201cexperts\u201d [from the parti pris Royal Meteorological Society \u2013 which tells you all you need to know, really] to the point where it is allegedly \u201cbullet-proof.\u201d\nPerhaps Climate Change will sell, either because people mistake it for one of the funny books or because of its royal connection.\nBut while it may be a canny move for the publisher, it\u2019s not such a smart decision by the Prince of Wales who appears to have forgotten \u2013 not for the first time, it must be said \u2013 that he is heir to the British throne and required by the custom of constitutional monarchy not to meddle in politics.\nClimate change has almost everything to do with politics \u2013 a fact emphasised by the Prince\u2019s desperately unfortunate choice of co-author. Tony Juniper is a green activist; while at the vigorously anti-free-market, anti-growth Friends of the Earth he led the successful campaign to insinuate the disastrous Climate Change Bill into the Queen\u2019s Speech \u2013 thereby acting as enabler for some of the most expensive and pointless legislation in UK parliamentary history, the Climate Change Act which will cost the taxpayer around \u00a319 billion every year till 2050 in \u2018decarbonisation\u2019 projects.\nGiven that the climate change scare is being made to look more and more foolish by the day, it\u2019s bizarre that the heir to the British throne should continue so assiduously to promote it.\nEither Prince Charles needs to learn a degree of self-restraint \u2013 or get himself some wiser counsellors, pronto. His mother, Her Majesty the Queen isn\u2019t going to stay on the throne forever. More\u2019s the pity."}
{"headline": "the trump effect -- cdc cancels major climate change conference", "body": "The cancelled summit was intended to teach public health officials more about climate change, an idea that is widely backed by climate scientists. Former President Barack Obama made it a key focus of his administration.\nAnd this is exactly the problem which has beset so many public (and indeed private) institutions so long. From CDC to NASA to Departments from the Interior to Defense, government offshoots in the US \u2014 infiltrated by green entryists from below and encouraged by irresponsible prioritizing from above \u2014 have engaged in climate change activism which has nothing whatsoever to do with their core remit.\nThe CDC is a particularly egregious example of this environmentalist mission creep. Founded in 1946, its job is to protect public health and safety through the control and prevention of disease, injury, and disability in the US and internationally, with an annual budget in excess of $7 billion.\nWhat does \u201cclimate change\u201d have to do with this?\nNothing.\nBut that certainly hasn\u2019t stopped the richly-funded climate alarmism industry trying to prove otherwise. (Why? Because if climate change can be demonstrated to be a public health issue than clearly it merits still further government spending\u2026.)\nLast year, for example, the US Global Change Research Program produced a 300-page document called The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment.\nHowever, this told us rather less about the health impacts of climate change than it does about the power and tentacular reach of the global warming industry. The US Global Change Research Program sounds authoritative \u2014 and with its $2.5 billion annual budget certainly has the power to make its opinions known. But all it did in that report was synthesise the work of other US government agencies such as NASA and NOAA, and from global institutions like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which are themselves in thrall to the dubious and corrupt science of the climate alarmism industry. It is just one gigantic echo chamber \u2014 whose purpose is to repeat and amplify the politically correct climate message.\nThe evidence that man-made climate change is damaging to human health is at best flimsy, at worst fabricated.\nIn 1996, for example, the IPCC\u2019s Second Assessment Report claimed that \u201cclimate change\u201d would result in an increase the range and intensity \u201cvector-borne diseases\u201d such as malaria, and that therefore it posed a great threat to human health.\nAs Christopher Booker recalls in his book The Great Global Warming Disaster, this was so far from the truth that one of the authors in the IPCC Working Group responsible for this claim resigned in disgust.\nProfessor Paul Reiter, of the Institut Pasteur in Paris, is the world\u2019s leading authority on mosquito-borne diseases. Not one of the lead authors in his group, he was appalled to discover, had similar relevant expertise. One was mainly interested in the effectiveness of motorcycle helmets; two others were environmental activists, one of whom had written on mercury poisoning and land mines.\nSo Professor Reiter was somewhat perturbed when the \u201camateurish text\u201d summarizing his group\u2019s report claimed the opposite of what he knew to be true. It claimed, for example, that \u201cmosquito species that transmit malaria do not usually survive where the mean winter temperature drops below 16-18 degrees C\u201d. But some species, Reiter pointed out, can survive temperatures of 25 degrees below zero.\nReiter said: \u201cIn summary the treatment of this issue by the IPCC was ill-informed, biased and scientifically unacceptable.\u201d\nYet the IPCC\u2019s Summary for Policymakers still used this chapter to support its claim that \u201cclimate change is likely to have wide-ranging and mostly adverse impacts on human health with significant loss of life.\u201d\nThis is the massive global scam that the Trump administration is now beginning to unravel.\nThere were be much squealing from the many interest groups with their snouts in the trough, such as Edward Maibach, director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University.\nMaibach, who was due to speak at the CDC conference, told the Washington Post:\nI don\u2019t know why they canceled the meeting, but I do know the meeting was important and should have been held. Politics is politics, but protecting the health of our citizens is one of our government\u2019s most important obligations to us\u2026 Climate change is bad for America, and bad for the world, in so many ways. One of these ways is that it is harming our health, already, and is likely to get much worse over the next few decades unless we take action. As the nation\u2019s public health agency, we need CDC to be fully engaged in protecting our health from climate change.\nBut of course Maibach would say that. He\u2019s one of the dodgy academics who were involved in what has been described as the \u201clargest scientific scandal in history\u201d, where a scientist at GMU was found to have raked in $63 million in federal grants by riding the climate change gravy train."}

She hailed the United Nations, praised the World Bank, and called NATO \u201cthe cornerstone\u201d of Western defence.\nAnd Mrs. May also spoke of the necessity for multilateralism in stark contrast with the line pushed by the White House \u2014 which prefers bilateralism \u2014 over recent days. She cited the need to tackle \u201cclimate change\u201d as one of the reasons to back globalist institutions.\nShe called for the two nations to be \u201cinternationalist\u201d and \u201cglobal\u201d, though noted \u201cSome of these organisations are in need of reform and renewal\u201d.\nAnd while committing to the destruction of the Islamic State, she failed to mention the name of the group, choosing instead the term \u201cDaesh\u201d \u2014 a word preferred by politically correct types and most notably popularised by former Secretary of State John Kerry and President Barack Obama.\nShe went on to describe \u201cradical Islamists\u201d, stopping short of echoing the phrases used by the new U.S. administration including \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d.\nThe British PM stated: \u201cOf course we should always be careful to distinguish between this extreme and hateful ideology and the peaceful religion of Islam, and the hundreds of millions of its adherents, including millions of our own citizens, and those further afield who are so often the first victims of this ideology\u2019s terror\u201d.\nAnd while Mrs. May hailed the founding principle of \u201cliberty\u201d and claimed the title of \u201cconservative\u201d to draw parallels between her beliefs and those of Republican attendees, she is perhaps best known in the United Kingdom for an unprecedented expansion of the surveillance state and indeed mass migration at historic levels.\nMrs. May was a Remain campaigner during the Brexit referendum, and also used her speech in Philadelphia to underscore her commitment to Britain\u2019s foreign aid spending.\nAnd while the British government voted against the State of Israel in the now infamous UN Security Council vote in December, she stated that democratic allies like the Jewish state must be protected.\nMrs. May spoke of verification and \u201cpolicing\u201d of the Iranian nuclear deal and spoke of the trading relationship between the United Kingdom and United States.\nCuriously, despite Britain\u2019s Brexit vote, Mrs. May said of the European Union: \u201cWe will build a new partnership with our friends in Europe. We are not turning our back on them, or on the interests and the values that we share. It remains overwhelmingly in our interests \u2013 and in those of the wider world \u2013 that the EU should succeed\u201d."}
{"headline": "full speech: theresa may hails globalism, calls for action on climate change", "body": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May used her speech in Philadelphia today to warn over climate change, call Islam a religion of peace, and hail globalist institutions such as the World Bank and United Nations.\nThe full text of the speech follows:\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nMajority Leader McConnell, Mr Speaker, Distinguished Members of the Senate and Representatives of the House.\nI would like to thank Congress and the Congressional Institute for the invitation to be here today. The opportunity to visit the United States is always special. And to be invited to be the first serving Head of Government to address this important conference is an honour indeed.\nI defy any person to travel to this great country at any time and not to be inspired by its promise and its example.\nFor more than two centuries, the very idea of America \u2013 drawn from history and given written form in a small hall not far from here \u2013 has lit up the world.\nThat idea \u2013 that all are created equal and that all are born free \u2013 has never been surpassed in the long history of political thought.\nAnd it is here \u2013 on the streets and in the halls of this great city of Philadelphia \u2013 that the founding fathers first set it down, that the textbook of freedom was written, and that this great nation that grew \u201cfrom sea to shining sea\u201d was born.\nSince that day, it has been America\u2019s destiny to bear the leadership of the free world and to carry that heavy responsibility on its shoulders. But my country, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, has been proud to share that burden and to walk alongside you at every stage.\nFor the past century, Britain and America \u2013 and the unique and special relationship that exists between us \u2013 have taken the idea conceived by those \u201cfifty-six rank-and-file, ordinary citizens\u201d, as President Reagan called them, forward. And because we have done so, time and again it is the relationship between us that has defined the modern world.\nOne hundred years ago this April, it was your intervention in the First World War that helped Britain, France, our friends in the Commonwealth and other allies to maintain freedom in Europe.\nA little more than seventy-five years ago, you responded to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour by joining Britain in the Second World War and defeating fascism not just in the Pacific but in Africa and Europe too.\nAnd later, in the aftermath of these wars, our two countries led the West through the Cold War, confronting communism and ultimately defeating it not just through military might, but by winning the war of ideas. And by proving that open, liberal, democratic societies will always defeat those that are closed, coercive and cruel.\nBut the leadership provided by our two countries through the Special Relationship has done more than win wars and overcome adversity. It made the modern world.\nThe institutions upon which that world relies were so often conceived or inspired by our two nations working together.\nThe United Nations \u2013 in need of reform, but vital still \u2013 has its foundations in the Special Relationship, from the original Declaration of St James\u2019 Palace to the Declaration by United Nations, signed in Washington, and drafted themselves by Winston Churchill and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\nThe World Bank and International Monetary Fund, born in the post-war world at Bretton Woods, were conceived by our two nations working together.\nAnd NATO \u2013 the cornerstone of the West\u2019s defence \u2013 was established on the bonds of trust and mutual interests that exist between us.\nSome of these organisations are in need of reform and renewal to make them relevant to our needs today. But we should be proud of the role our two nations \u2013 working in partnership \u2013 played in bringing them into being, and in bringing peace and prosperity to billions of people as a result.\nBecause it is through our actions over many years, working together to defeat evil or to open up the world, that we have been able to fulfil the promise of those who first spoke of the special nature of the relationship between us. The promise of freedom, liberty and the rights of man.\n\u201cWe must never cease\u201d, Churchill said, \u201cto proclaim in fearless tones the great principles of freedom and the rights of man which are the joint inheritance of the English-speaking world and which through Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Habeas Corpus, trial by jury, and the English common law, find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of Independence\u201d.\nSo it is my honour and my privilege to stand before you today in this great city of Philadelphia to proclaim them again, to join hands as we pick up that mantle of leadership once more, to renew our Special Relationship and to recommit ourselves to the responsibility of leadership in the modern world.\nCHANGE IN AMERICA\nAnd it is my honour and privilege to do so at this time, as dawn breaks on a new era of American renewal.\nFor I speak to you not just as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but as a fellow Conservative who believes in the same principles that underpin the agenda of your Party. The value of liberty. The dignity of work. The principles of nationhood, family, economic prudence, patriotism \u2013 and putting power in the hands of the people.\nPrinciples instilled in me from a young age. Principles that my parents taught me in the vicarage in Southern England in which I was raised.\nI know that it is these principles that you have put at the heart of your plan for government.\nAnd your victory in these elections gives you the opportunity to put them at the heart of this new era of American renewal too.\nPresident Trump\u2019s victory \u2013 achieved in defiance of all the pundits and the polls \u2013 and rooted not in the corridors of Washington, but in the hopes and aspirations of working men and women across this land. Your Party\u2019s victory in both the Congress and the Senate where you swept all before you, secured with great effort, and achieved with an important message of national renewal.\nAnd because of this \u2013 because of what you have done together, because of that great victory you have won \u2013 America can be stronger, greater, and more confident in the years ahead.\nCHANGE IN BRITAIN\nAnd a newly emboldened, confident America is good for the world.\nAn America that is strong and prosperous at home is a nation that can lead abroad. But you cannot \u2013 and should not \u2013 do so alone. You have said that it is time for others to step up. And I agree.\nSovereign countries cannot outsource their security and prosperity to America. And they should not undermine the alliances that keep us strong by failing to step up and play their part.\nThis is something Britain has always understood. It is why Britain is the only country in the G20 \u2013 other than yours \u2013 to meet its commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence, and to invest 20% of that in upgrading equipment. It is why Britain is the only country in the G20 to spend 0.7% of gross national income on overseas development. It is why my first act as Prime Minister last year was to lead the debate in Parliament that ensured the renewal of Britain\u2019s independent nuclear deterrent. And it is why the Government I lead will increase spending on defence in every year of this Parliament.\nIt is why Britain is a leading member \u2013 alongside the United States \u2013 of the coalition working successfully to defeat Daesh; why we have agreed to send 800 troops to Estonia and Poland as part of NATO\u2019s forward presence in eastern Europe; why we are increasing our troop contribution to NATO\u2019s Resolute Support mission that defends the Afghan government from terrorism; and it is why we are reinforcing our commitment to peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, South Sudan and Somalia.\nAnd it is why Britain is leading the way in pioneering international efforts to crack down on modern slavery \u2013 one of the great scourges of our world \u2013 wherever it is found. I hope you will join us in that cause \u2013 and I commend Senator Corker in particular for his work in this field. It is good to see him here today.\nAs Americans know, the United Kingdom is by instinct and history a great, global nation that recognises its responsibilities to the world.\nAnd as we end our membership of the European Union \u2013 as the British people voted with determination and quiet resolve to do last year \u2013 we have the opportunity to reassert our belief in a confident, sovereign and Global Britain, ready to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike.\nWe will build a new partnership with our friends in Europe. We are not turning our back on them, or on the interests and the values that we share. It remains overwhelmingly in our interests \u2013 and in those of the wider world \u2013 that the EU should succeed. And for as long as we remain members we will continue to play our full part, just as we will continue to cooperate on security, foreign policy and trade once we have left.\nBut we have chosen a different future for our country.\nA future that sees us restore our parliamentary sovereignty and national self-determination, and to become even more global and internationalist in action and in spirit.\nA future that sees us take back control of the things that matter to us \u2013 things like our national borders and immigration policy, and the way we decide and interpret our own laws \u2013 so that we are able to shape a better, more prosperous future for the working men and women of Britain.\nA future that sees us step up with confidence to a new, even more internationalist role, where we meet our responsibilities to our friends and allies, champion the international cooperation and partnerships that project our values around the world, and continue to act as one of the strongest and most forceful advocates for business, free markets and free trade anywhere around the globe.\nThis is a vision of a future that my country can unite around \u2013 and that I hope your country, as our closest friend and ally, can welcome and support.\nA RENEWED SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP\nSo as we rediscover our confidence together \u2013 as you renew your nation just as we renew ours \u2013 we have the opportunity \u2013 indeed the responsibility \u2013 to renew the Special Relationship for this new age. We have the opportunity to lead, together, again.\nBecause the world is passing through a period of change \u2013 and in response to that change we can either be passive bystanders, or we can take the opportunity once more to lead. And to lead together.\nI believe it is in our national interest to do so. Because the world is increasingly marked by instability and threats that threaten to undermine our way of life and the very things that we hold dear.\nThe end of the Cold War did not give rise to a New World Order. It did not herald the End of History. It did not lead to a new age of peace, prosperity and predictability in world affairs.\nFor some \u2013 the citizens of Central and Eastern Europe in particular \u2013 it brought new freedom.\nBut across the world, ancient ethnic, religious and national rivalries \u2013 rivalries that had been frozen through the decades of the Cold War \u2013 returned.\nNew enemies of the West and our values \u2013 in particular in the form of Radical Islamists \u2013 have emerged.\nAnd countries with little tradition of democracy, liberty and human rights \u2013 notably China and Russia \u2013 have grown more assertive in world affairs.\nThe rise of the Asian economies \u2013 China yes, but democratic allies like India too \u2013 is hugely welcome. Billions are being lifted out of poverty and new markets for our industries are opening up.\nBut these events \u2013 coming as they have at the same time as the financial crisis and its fall out, as well as a loss of confidence in the West following 9/11, the military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and sporadic terrorist attacks \u2013 have led many to fear that, in this century, we will experience the eclipse of the West.\nBut there is nothing inevitable about that. Other countries may grow stronger. Big, populous countries may grow richer. And as they do so, they may start to embrace more fully our values of democracy and liberty.\nBut even if they do not, our interests will remain. Our values will endure. And the need to defend them and project them will be as important as ever.\nSo we \u2013 our two countries together \u2013 have a joint responsibility to lead. Because when others step up as we step back, it is bad for America, for Britain and the world.\nIt is in our interests \u2013 those of Britain and America together \u2013 to stand strong together to defend our values, our interests and the very ideas in which we believe.\nThis cannot mean a return to the failed policies of the past. The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over. But nor can we afford to stand idly by when the threat is real and when it is in our own interests to intervene. We must be strong, smart and hard-headed. And we must demonstrate the resolve necessary to stand up for our interests.\nAnd whether it is the security of Israel in the Middle East or Estonia in the Baltic states, we must always stand up for our friends and allies in democratic countries that find themselves in tough neighbourhoods too.\nWe each have different political traditions. We will sometimes pursue different domestic policies. And there may be occasions on which we disagree. But the common values and interests that bring us together are hugely powerful.\nAnd \u2013 as your foremost friend and ally \u2013 we support many of the priorities your government has laid out for America\u2019s engagement with the world.\nIt is why I join you in your determination to take on and defeat Daesh and the ideology of Islamic extremism that inspires them and many others terrorist groups in the world today. It is in both of our national interests to do so. This will require us to use the intelligence provided by the finest security agencies in the world. And it will require the use of military might.\nBut it also demands a wider effort. Because one of the lessons of fighting terrorism in the last 15 years or so is yes, killing terrorists can save innocent lives. But until we kill the idea that drives them, the ideology, we will always have to live with this threat.\nAnd as they are defeated on the ground, the terrorists are exploiting the internet and social media to spread this ideology that is preying on vulnerable citizens in our own countries, inspiring them to commit acts of terror in our own cities.\nThat is why the UK has led the world in developing a strategy for preventing violent extremism, and why the British and American governments are working together to take on and defeat the ideology of Islamist Extremism. I look forward to working with the President and his Administration to step up our efforts still further in order to defeat this evil ideology.\nBut of course, we should always be careful to distinguish between this extreme and hateful ideology, and the peaceful religion of Islam and the hundreds of millions of its adherents \u2013 including millions of our own citizens and those further afield who are so often the first victims of this ideology\u2019s terror. And nor is it enough merely to focus on violent extremism. We need to address the whole spectrum of extremism, starting with the bigotry and hatred that can so often turn to violence.\nYet ultimately to defeat Daesh, we must employ all of the diplomatic means at our disposal. That means working internationally to secure a political solution in Syria and challenging the alliance between the Syrian regime and its backers in Tehran.\nWhen it comes to Russia, as so often it is wise to turn to the example of President Reagan who \u2013 during negotiations with his opposite number Mikhail Gorbachev \u2013 used to abide by the adage \u201ctrust but verify\u201d. With President Putin, my advice is to \u201cengage but beware\u201d.\nThere is nothing inevitable about conflict between Russia and the West. And nothing unavoidable about retreating to the days of the Cold War. But we should engage with Russia from a position of strength. And we should build the relationships, systems and processes that make cooperation more likely than conflict \u2013 and that, particularly after the illegal annexation of Crimea, give assurance to Russia\u2019s neighbouring states that their security is not in question. We should not jeopardise the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putin\u2019s claim that it is now in his sphere of influence.\nAnd progress on this issue would also help to secure another of this nation\u2019s priorities \u2013 to reduce Iran\u2019s malign influence in the Middle East.\nThis is a priority for the UK too as we support our allies in the Gulf States to push back against Iran\u2019s aggressive efforts to build an arc of influence from Tehran through to the Mediterranean.\nThe nuclear deal with Iran was controversial. But it has neutralised the possibility of the Iranians acquiring nuclear weapons for more than a decade. It has seen Iran remove 13,000 centrifuges together with associated infrastructure and eliminate its stock of 20% enriched uranium. That was vitally important for regional security. But the agreement must now be very carefully and rigorously policed \u2013 and any breaches should be dealt with firmly and immediately.\nSTRONG INSTITUTIONS AND NATIONS\nTo deal with the threats of the modern world, we need to rebuild confidence in the institutions upon which we all rely.\nIn part that means multinational institutions. Because we know that so many of the threats we face today \u2013 global terrorism, climate change, and unprecedented mass movements of people \u2013 do not respect national borders. So we must turn towards those multinational institutions like the UN and NATO that encourage international cooperation and partnership.\nBut those multinational institutions need to work for the countries that formed them, and to serve the needs and interests of the people of those nations. They have no democratic mandate of their own. So I share your reform agenda and believe that, by working together, we can make those institutions more relevant and purposeful than they are today.\nI call on others, therefore, to join us in that effort and to ensure they step up and contribute as they should. That is why I have encouraged Antonio Guterres, the new UN Secretary General, to pursue an ambitious reform programme, focusing the United Nations on its core functions of peacekeeping, conflict prevention and resolution. And it is why I have already raised with my fellow European leaders the need to deliver on their commitments to spend 2% of their GDP on defence \u2013 and 20% of their defence budgets on equipment.\nIt is also why I have already raised with Jens Stoltenberg \u2013 the Secretary General of NATO \u2013 the need to make sure the Alliance is as equipped to fight terrorism and cyber warfare, as it is to fight more conventional forms of war.\nAmerica\u2019s leadership role in NATO \u2013 supported by Britain \u2013 must be the central element around which the Alliance is built. But alongside this continued commitment, I am also clear that EU nations must similarly step up to ensure this institution that provides the cornerstone of the West\u2019s defence continues to be as effective as it can be.\nYet the most important institution is \u2013 and should always be \u2013 the nation state. Strong nations form strong institutions. And they form the basis of the international partnerships and cooperation that bring stability to our world.\nNations, accountable to their populations \u2013 \u201cderiving\u201d as the Declaration of Independence puts it \u201ctheir just powers from the consent of the governed\u201d \u2013 can choose to join international organisations, or not. They can choose to cooperate with others, or not. Choose to trade with others, or not.\nWhich is why if the countries of the European Union wish to integrate further, my view is that they should be free to do so. Because that is what they choose.\nBut Britain \u2013 as a sovereign nation with the same values but a different political and cultural history \u2013 has chosen to take a different path.\nBecause our history and culture is profoundly internationalist.\nWe are a European country \u2013 and proud of our shared European heritage \u2013 but we are also a country that has always looked beyond Europe to the wider world. We have ties of family, kinship and history to countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and countries across Africa, the Pacific and Caribbean.\nAnd of course, we have ties of kinship, language and culture to these United States too. As Churchill put it, we \u201cspeak the same language, kneel at the same altars and, to a very large extent, pursue the same ideals\u201d.\nAnd, today, increasingly we have strong economic, commercial, defence and political relationships as well.\nSo I am delighted that the new Administration has made a trade agreement between our countries one of its earliest priorities. A new trade deal between Britain and America must work for both sides and serve both of our national interests. It must help to grow our respective economies and to provide the high-skilled, high-paid jobs of the future for working people across America and across the UK.\nAnd it must work for those who have too often felt left behind by the forces of globalisation. People, often those on modest incomes living in relatively rich countries like our own, who feel that the global system of free markets and free trade is simply not working for them in its current form.\nSuch a deal \u2013 allied to the reforms we are making to our own economy to ensure wealth and opportunity is spread across our land \u2013 can demonstrate to those who feel locked out and left behind that free markets, free economies and free trade can deliver the brighter future they need. And it can maintain \u2013 indeed it can build \u2013 support for the rules-based international system on which the stability of our world continues to rely.\nThe UK is already America\u2019s fifth largest export destination, while your markets account for almost a fifth of global exports from our shores. Exports to the UK from this State of Pennsylvania alone account for more than $2 billion a year. The UK is the largest market in the EU \u2013 and the third largest market in the world \u2013 for exporters here.\nAmerica is the largest single destination for UK outward investment and the single largest investor in the UK. And your companies are investing or expanding in the UK at a rate of more than ten projects a week.\nBritish companies employ people in every US state from Texas to Vermont. And the UK-US Defence relationship is the broadest, deepest and most advanced of any two countries, sharing military hardware and expertise. And of course, we have recently invested in the new F-35 strike aircraft for our new aircraft carriers that will secure our naval presence \u2013 and increase our ability to project our power around the world \u2013 for years to come.\nBecause of these strong economic and commercial links \u2013 and our shared history and the strength of our relationship \u2013 I look forward to pursuing talks with the new Administration about a new UK/US Free Trade Agreement in the coming months. It will take detailed work, but we welcome your openness to those discussions and hope we can make progress so that the new, Global Britain that emerges after Brexit is even better equipped to take its place confidently in the world.\nCONCLUSION\nSuch an agreement would see us taking that next step in the special relationship that exists between us. Cementing and affirming one of the greatest forces for progress this world has ever known.\nSeventy years ago in 1946, Churchill proposed a new phase in this relationship \u2013 to win a Cold War that many had not even realised had started. He described how an iron curtain had fallen from the Baltic to the Adriatic, covering all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe: Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Sofia and Bucharest.\nToday those great cities \u2013 homes of great culture and heritage \u2013 live in freedom and peace. And they do so because of the leadership of Britain and America, and of Mrs Thatcher and President Reagan.\nThey do so \u2013 ultimately \u2013 because our ideas will always prevail.\nAnd they do so because, when the world demands leadership, it is this alliance of values and interests \u2013 this Special Relationship between two countries \u2013 that, to borrow the words of another great American statesman, enters the arena, with our faces marred by dust and sweat and blood, to strive valiantly and know the triumph of high achievement.\nAs we renew the promise of our nations to make them stronger at home \u2013 in the words of President Reagan as the \u201csleeping giant stirs\u201d \u2013 so let us renew the relationship that can lead the world towards the promise of freedom and prosperity marked out in parchment by those ordinary citizens 240 years ago.\nSo that we may not be counted with the \u201ccold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat\u201d, but with those who \u201cstrive to do the deeds\u201d that will lead us to a better world.\nThat better future is within reach. Together, we can build it."}
{"headline": "federal scientist cooked climate change books ahead of obama presentation, whistle blower charges", "body": "A key Obama administration scientist brushed aside inconvenient data that showed a slowdown in global warming in compiling an alarming 2015 report that coincided with the White House participation in the Paris Climate Conference, a whistle blower is alleging.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in a major 2013 report, concluded global temperatures had shown a smaller increase from 1998 to 2012 than any similar period over the past 30 to 60 years. But a blockbuster, June 2015 paper by a team of federal scientists led by Thomas Karl, published in the journal Science in June 2015 and later known as the \u201cpausebuster\" paper sought to discredit the notion of a slowdown in warming.\nExpand / Contract Karl was director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information when the report was published. (NOAA)\n\"Our new analysis suggests that the apparent hiatus may have been largely the result of limitations in past datasets, and that the rate of warming over the first 15 years of this century has, in fact, been as fast or faster than that seen over the last half of the 20th century,\" Karl, who was at the time director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information, said at the time.\nExpand / Contract Smith, R-Texas, questioned the timing of the report.\nThe report argued that evidence shows there was no \u201chiatus\u201d in rising global temperatures and that they had been increasing in the 21st century just as quickly as in the last half of the 20th century.\nRep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Science Committee, questioned the timing, noting the paper was published just before the Obama Administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan was submitted to the Paris Climate Conference of 2015.\n\"In the summer of 2015, whistleblowers alerted the Committee that the Karl study was rushed to publication before underlying data issues were resolved to help influence public debate about the so-called Clean Power Plan and upcoming Paris climate conference,\" Smith said in a statement. \"Since then, the Committee has attempted to obtain information that would shed further light on these allegations, but was obstructed at every turn by the previous administration\u2019s officials.\"\nKarl denied the paper was released to boost the plan.\nKarl\u2019s neglect of the IPCC data was purposeful, according to John Bates, a recently retired scientist from the National Climactic Data Center at the NOAA. Bates came forward just days ago to charge that the 2015 study selectively used misleading and unverified data \u2013 effectively putting NOAA\u2019s thumb on the scale.\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, Bates said Karl was \u201cinsisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximized warming and minimized documentation\u2026 in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming pause, rushed so that he could time publication to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy.\u201d\nFor example, Karl allegedly adjusted temperature data collected by robot buoys upward to match earlier data from ocean-going ships. That was problematic, Bates said, because ships generate heat and could cause readings to vary.\n\u201cThey had good data from buoys,\u201d Bates told the Daily Mail. \u201cAnd they threw it out and \u2018corrected\u2019 it by using the bad data from ships. You never change good data to agree with bad, but that\u2019s what they did \u2013 so as to make it look as if the sea was warmer.\u201d\nBates, who could not be reached for comment, but has published some of his allegations in a blog, claims to have documentation of his explosive charges and indicated more revelations are coming.\nA NOAA spokesman, in an email to The Washington Times, said NOAA \u201cstands behind its world-class scientists\u201d but also that it \u201ctakes seriously any allegation that its internal processes have not been followed and will review the matter appropriately.\u201d\nBates is not the first to question Karl\u2019s conclusions. A paper by Canadian climate modeler John Fyfe questioned the 2015 study. As he put it, in a 2016 article from the journal Nature Climate Change, \u201cthere is a mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what observations are showing. We can\u2019t ignore it.\u201d\nClimate scientists have closed ranks around Karl. A study published last month in Science Advances, by Zeke Hausfather of University of California Berkeley and five others, claims to confirm Karl\u2019s findings.\nIn addition, climate scientist Peter Thorne, who has worked with the NOAA, said Bates wasn\u2019t involved in the work that he\u2019s criticizing. Bates disputed the assertion.\nWhile Karl, and other scientists who believe man-made climate change poses a major threat had the ear of the Obama administration, President Trump has shown signs of skepticism. It remains to be seen from which scientists he will take his cue.\nReporting for this article provided by the Fox News Investigative Unit and Brainroom"}
{"headline": "'scientific american' blames climate change for oroville dam", "body": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nScientific American published an article Monday claiming that climate change is to blame for the ongoing Oroville Dam crisis, due to engineering calculations made that did not anticipate global warming.\nThe author, Jane Braxton Little, argues:\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nThe dam was built in the 1960s when temperatures were cooler and more precipitation was stored in a greater snowpack in the mountains of the Feather River watershed, which drains into Lake Oroville. Today warming temperatures are bringing more rain as well as melting the Sierra Nevada snowpack earlier in the spring.\nLittle notes that two California counties surrounding Lake Oroville, Butte and Plumas, challenged the state\u2019s environmental review of the dam in 2008, arguing the state \u201crecklessly failed\u201d to account properly for climate change in its long-term dam management plan.\nThe attorneys in the lawsuit predicted a faster flow of water downhill. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened a week ago, leading to the crater,\u201d Little concludes, offering no scientific basis for her conclusion.\nAt the time of the lawsuit, attorneys for the California Department of Water Resources (which owns the dam) argued that the counties\u2019 speculation about climate change speculation was \u201ctoo speculative\u201d to warrant inclusion in their review, Little notes.\nSimilarly, climate scientists themselves have refused to link recent forest fires in California to climate change \u2014 contradicting Governor Jerry Brown himself.\nThis brings the entire debate full circle. The Oroville Dam \u2014 and almost 1500 other dams \u2014 are not in jeopardy because of climate change. Rather, they are in jeopardy because of policy decisions made by those in charge \u2014 Democrats, for the past decade \u2014 to ignore tcritical infrastructure in favor of pandering to groups who could guarantee their reelection for decades.\nIn the end, the politicians chose illegal aliens, powerful public sector unions and the environmental lobby over dams and infrastructure.\nTim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman."}

I know: I\u2019ve got one and I am putty in her hands.\nIf she wants a pony and bats her eyelashes at me, I\u2019ll be off in a trice to buy her a herd. Baby unicorn ponies, if that\u2019s what she prefers. With jewels inlaid in their spiral horns and maybe some magical attachment that plays the collected works of Taylor Swift while she rides.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nSo I totally get where President Trump is coming from when I read reports that, under the influence of Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, he has toned the phrasing of an Executive Order so that it no longer includes derogatory comments about the utterly useless and pointless climate deal signed in Paris in 2015 by Barack Obama.\nKushner and Ivanka \u201cintervened to strike language about the climate deal from an earlier draft of the executive order,\u201d sources familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. Ivanka and her husband \u201chave been considered a moderating influence on the White House\u2019s position on climate change and environmental issues,\u201d WSJ reports. Now, the executive order will have no mention of the so-called Paris agreement.\nIf it\u2019s just a case of casual daughter-pleasing, fine. But if he actually means it than we should all start to worry.\nI\u2019ve said it before but it\u2019s worth saying again: if President Trump proves to be as radical on energy and climate as he promised to be on the campaign trail, then this, even if he achieves nothing else, will more than qualify him for a place next to the greats on Mt Rushmore.\nHe will go down in history as the hero who slew ManBearPig: the president who, unlike his pusillanimous, career-safe, Establishment predecessors from Clinton and the Bushes to the ultimate horror that was Obama, finally had the courage, integrity and honesty to point out that the Climate Emperor is wearing no clothes; the guy who brought to the end the greatest scientific scandal ever; who saved Western Industrial Civilisation from the Watermelons.\nBut it\u2019s all very well having good instincts and good intentions. The hard part will be dealing with all the obstacles thrown in his way by the monstrously large group of special interests sometimes known as the Green Blob and sometimes as the Climate Industrial Complex.\nIvanka and Jared Kushner are part of that Green Blob. So is Hollywood. So is most of the mainstream media. So are most of the colleges, corporations, law firms, NGOs, local governments, schoolteachers, and even significant elements of the Republican party, like the GOP grandees currently agitating to introduce a Carbon Tax.\nTo get an idea of how big the problem is you should have been there at CPAC at the weekend, as I was, when Scott Pruitt \u2013 the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, was asked what he thought about man-made climate change.\nHe just didn\u2019t dare say.\nHere he was, in the seductive and friendly company of conservative interviewer Dr Gina Loudon, in front of a 100 per cent sympathetic audience of GOP faithful, and still he fudged the question with a waffling, awkward, embarrassed, fence-sitting, evasive, non-answer.\nAnd Scott Pruitt is one of the good guys \u2013 as we know from the fact that one of the main things he was known for doing when he was Oklahoma attorney general was suing the Agency of which he is now the head. I\u2019ve little doubt that he will do sterling work reining in the EPA\u2019s excesses and unravelling the environmentalists\u2019 anti-business, anti-property-rights, anti-liberty agenda. But judging on his public appearances in the fortnight since he was confirmed in the post, I\u2019d say he\u2019s sounding too much the cautious, career-safe politician and not enough the fearless and refreshing Trump-style radical.\nHis first speech as administrator was all about what a thorough and competent technocrat he\u2019s going to be.\n\u201cRegulations ought to make things regular,\u201d said Mr. Pruitt, repeating a line he used at his confirmation hearing in January. \u201cThose that we regulate ought to know what they can expect from us.\u201d\nAt CPAC, his main theme was the importance of restoring federalism and states\u2019 rights.\nAll sensible stuff. But if this Administration is really serious about slaying the Green Blob it\u2019s going to have to do better than merely hiding behind the Constitution and due process. It\u2019s going to need make a convincing case as to why all this stuff needs doing. Otherwise, the Trump Administration\u2019s best efforts are going to be swamped by green propaganda aimed at making it look uncaring and anti-environment and unscientific.\nWhat\u2019s so stupid is that making this case is really, really easy.\nI know because I did it at my three speaker events at CPAC. And if I can do it, anyone can.\nFirst, was this brilliant panel, expertly moderated by John Fund, in which blogger Tony Heller (aka Steven Goddard) and lawyer, blogger and EPA scourge Steve Milloy dealt with the basics: the climate data has been rigged by a corrupt, untrustworthy scientific establishment; there has been little global warming and what there has been is entirely within natural boundaries; the reason that this global scam appeals to so many different interest groups \u2013 politicians, activists, (mostly second-rate) scientists, rent-seekers etc \u2013 is that it caters to such a variety of motivations (political; religious; follow-the-money).\nSecond was a talk on energy economics with the fascinating Mark Mills of the Manhattan Institute who explained why renewables are such an inadequate and unnecessarily expensive response to the massively increasing global demand for energy; and why fossil fuels \u2013 especially shale gas and oil \u2013 are by far the most effective solution for at least the next few hundred years.\nThird was an equally enlightening talk with Dr Craig Idso of the Energy & Environment Legal Institute on how increased atmospheric CO2 is greening the planet \u2013 thus more than counteracting all the disasters the greenies have been predicting as CO2 levels rise.\nSo to recap:\nMan-made global warming is evidently and demonstrably not a problem.\nThe people who pretend otherwise are crooks, liars, idiots or shills.\nCO2 does far more good than harm.\nFossil fuels aren\u2019t running out \u2013 especially not now we\u2019ve discovered the game-changing technology of hydraulic fracturing \u2013 and are the ideal solution to our energy needs.\nRenewables are a waste of everyone\u2019s time \u2013 and always will be.\nThere is copious evidence to support all these statements and it\u2019s really about time those of us on the winning side of the argument stopped pussyfooting around and apologising for being 100 per cent right. That should include everyone in the Trump administration.\nNo more cautious speeches equivocating as to whether carbon dioxide is a problem or not, and whether we ought to have more renewables in the mix.\nThis is a revolution; we\u2019ve got truth and justice on our side; we owe the enemy nothing \u2013 and we really shouldn\u2019t count our job done till we\u2019ve crushed them, seen them driven before us and heard the lamentations of their women."}

{"headline": "delingpole: climate change is real because bad weather, explains wmo", "body": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nClimate Change is more real, and dangerous, and worrying than ever before because lots of bad weather has happened around the world.\nNow that I have handily summarised the World Meteorological Organization\u2019s (WMO) latest report \u2014 WMO Statement on the State of Global Climate in 2016 \u2014 you have no need to read it.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nThat\u2019s because the report\u2019s only intended function is as a propaganda device to prop up the global climate alarmist narrative.\nYou can tell this because of certain key phrases that have been embedded in the \u201cExecutive Summary.\u201d\nPhrases like:\nWarming continued in 2016, setting a new temperature record of approximately 1.1 \u00b0C above the pre-industrial period\u2026 \u2026against a background of long-term climate change\u2026. Severe droughts affected agriculture and yield production in many parts of the world, particularly in southern and eastern Africa and parts of Central America, where several million people experienced food insecurity and hundreds of thousands were displaced internally\u2026 Detection and attribution studies have demonstrated that human influence on the climate has been a main driver behind the unequivocal warming of the global climate system\u2026 Human influence has also led to significant regional temperature increases at the continental and subcontinental levels. Shifts of the temperature distribution to warmer regimes are expected to bring about increases in the frequency and intensity of extremely warm events.\nBut most of this stuff just comes from the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report, which was published in 2014. What, exactly, is its relevance to a new report on last year\u2019s weather?\nShort answer: none \u2014 but this was never the point.\nThe point is that the World Meteorological Organization has long been one of the chief promoters of the great global warming scare. The WMO was one of the two United Nations organizations \u2014 the other was the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) \u2013 which set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC exists on the unquestioned assumption that man-made climate change is a serious problem. Its only purposes are to find more evidence for the problem\u2019s existence and to propose various solutions for how to deal with it. At no stage, ever, can the IPCC admit to there not being a man-made climate change problem because that would mean doing itself out of business.\nThe WMO and its various UN sidekicks, in other words, represent the belly of the beast of the Climate Industrial Complex.\nThis is the rampaging monster against which President Trump has heroically pitted himself on his holy mission to slay the Green Blob.\nIt will not be an easy task \u2014 and it might even be a hopeless one for the Green Blob has many tentacles.\nOne of them is this rather noisome organisation, the Science Media Centre, which reports to be a neutral charity providing dispassionate information about science but, in fact, works as a tireless disseminator of green propaganda. In order to big up the WMO report, it has lined up various members of the usual suspects from the world of climate alarmism to testify about how amazingly important it is \u2014 and to dutifully confirm that, yes, global warming is, like, even worse than ever.\nWhy, here is Prof. Martin Siegert of the Grantham Institute, funded by climate alarmist hedge funder Jeremy Grantham, to promote the cause of climate alarmism:\nThe announcement from WMO is shocking but sadly unsurprising\u2026 We simply cannot say we haven\u2019t been warned, however. The problem is ours to fix and we must do so right now. The longer we wait for effective action the harder and more costly it will be.\nWell, whoulda thunk, eh?\nAnd here is the photogenic Dr. Emily Shuckburgh of the British Antarctic Survey:\nThe changes we are now seeing in the polar regions are a stark reminder of the scale and urgency of the climate challenge.\nOf course they are, Emily. Of course. And you didn\u2019t even need to use the phrase, \u201cBy the way, please can we have lots more grant funding?\u201d\nAnd here\u2019s Dr. Phil Williamson, speaking from the home of the Climategate scandal, the University of East Anglia:\nHuman-driven climate change is now an empirically-verifiable fact, combining year-to-year variability with the consequences of our release of extra greenhouse gases. Those who dispute that link are not sceptics, but anti-science deniers.\nSurely this can\u2019t be the same Dr. Phil Williamson whose complaint was humiliatingly rejected when he reported your humble correspondent to IPSO because he objected to a few pieces I\u2019d written explaining why Ocean Acidification was basically just another junk science scare intended to prop up the alarmist anti-CO2 narrative? Why yes. Exactly that Dr. Phil Williamson.\nTruly these people have no shame. And they can go on and on spouting all this nonsense because the braindead liberal media is more than happy to regurgitate it. As you can see, for example, from this pile of weapons-grade tosh from the Independent.\nNone of this scaremongering has any basis in reality, though, as Paul Homewood patiently explains in this masterly demolition job.\nHere is a taste:\n1) The record average temperature for the year of about 1.1C above pre-industrial levels Why is there no mention of the fact that satellite measurements of atmospheric temperatures prove that last year was statistically no warmer than 1998? Even if the figure is right, so what. Why should the Earth\u2019s climate be any worse now than it was 10 years ago, or 50, or 150? 2) Millions of people going hungry after crops failed in parts of Africa as rainfall fell up to 60 per cent below average. Where is the context that proves this is in any way unusual or unprecedented? Why is there no mention of studies, such as this by McCabe & Wolock in 2015, that there has been no trend in global droughts in the last century. Not to mention HH Lamb\u2019s evidence that global cooling leads to worse droughts. 3) Flooding that displaced hundreds of thousands of people in south-east Asia In 1971, the Red River floods left 100,000 dead in North Vietnam. In the same year, Orissa in India was hit by a cyclone which left 10,800 dead, and 180,000 were affected in the Kuala Lumpur floods, reckoned to be the worst floods since 1926. https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/is-our-climate-becoming-more-extreme/ What is so special about 2016?\nAs is confirmed by a separate report \u2014 The State of the Climate in 2016 \u2014 published Wednesday by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, there is absolutely nothing weird, alarming, or unprecedented about current global weather patterns.\nWhile 2016 was one of the warmest years on record, global temperatures dropped back at the end of the year to levels prior to the strong 2015/16 El Ni\u00f1o. This fact suggests that much of the global 2015\u201316 temperature peak was caused by a one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1os on record.\nSince 2003, the global temperature estimate based on surface station measurements has consistently drifted away from the satellite-based estimate in a warm direction, and is now about 0.1\u25e6C higher.\nMuch of the heat given off during the 2015\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o appears to have been transported to the polar regions, especially to the Arctic, causing severe weather phenomena and unseasonably high air temperatures.\nData from tide gauges all over the world suggest an average global sea-level rise of 1\u20131.5 mm/year, while the satellite-derived record suggests a rise of more than 3 mm/yr. This noticeable difference between the two data sets still has no broadly accepted explanation.\nArctic and Antarctic sea-ice extents since 1979 have developed in opposite directions, decreasing and increasing, respectively. In the Arctic, a 5.3-year periodic variation is important, while for the Antarctic a cycle of about 4.5 years duration is important. Both these variations reached their minima simultaneously in 2016, which explains the recent minimum in global sea-ice extent.\nThe report\u2019s author, Dr. Ole Humlum, Professor of Physical Geography at the University Centre in Svalbard (Norway), based his report on real-world observations \u2014 as opposed to the models and projections relied on by climate alarmists.\nHe says:\nThere is little doubt that we are living in a warm period. However, there is also little doubt that current climate change is not abnormal and not outside the range of natural variations that might be expected.\nBut don\u2019t expect to read that reported anytime soon by the mainstream media."}

The drought in the eastern Mediterranean is the worst ever on record \u2013 the records only go back 900 years, but it\u2019s historic. \u201cAnd 1.5 million climate refugees were driven into the cities in Syria, where they collided with refugees from the Iraq War. \u201cWikileaks revealed the internal conversations in the Syrian government where they were saying to one another \u2018we can\u2019t handle this, there\u2019s going to be a social explosion\u2019. There are other causes of the Syrian civil war, but this was the principal one.\u201d\nThis, Gore went on to explain, led to an \u201cincredible flow of refugees into Europe, which is creating political instability and which contributed in some ways to the desire of some in the UK to say \u2018whoa, we\u2019re not sure we want to be part of that anymore\u2019\u201d.\nThough it\u2019s true that climate alarmists, including Gore, the Prince of Wales, and sweary chanteuse Charlotte Church, have sought to blame the Syrian crisis on drought induced by \u201cclimate change\u201d, there is little evidence for this. [For details see my previous pieces on the subject: \u201cNo, Prince Charles, Climate Change Is Not Responsible For Syria or ISIS\u201c and \u201cFor The Last Time, No, The Syrian Crisis Was Not Caused By Climate Change\u201d and \u201cNo, Charlotte Church, the Syrian War Was Not Caused By Climate Change\u201d.]\nThis is almost certainly the first time climate change has been blamed for Brexit.\nIt comes only days after a study produced by the British Medical Journal linking climate change with diabetes.\nIn conclusion, diabetes incidence rate in the USA and prevalence of glucose intolerance worldwide increase with higher outdoor temperature. On the basis of our results, a 1\u00b0C rise in environmental temperature would account for over 100 000 new diabetes cases per year in the USA alone, given a population of nearly 322 million people in 2015.38 These findings emphasize the importance of future research into the effects of environmental temperature on glucose metabolism and the onset of diabetes, especially in view of the global rise in temperatures with a new record set for the warmest winter in the USA last year.39\nClimate change alarmism, you might say, has jumped the shark.

{"headline": "'climate change' no more credible than magic says top physicist", "body": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nThe evidence for man-made climate change is so flimsy that you might just as well believe in magic, says one of the world\u2019s top physicists.\nRichard Lindzen, Alfred P Sloan Professor of Atmospheric Sciences, Emeritus at Massachussetts Institute of Technology, has long expressed doubts about the \u201cscience\u201d behind anthropogenic global warming theory. (h/t Paul Homewood)\nNow, in probably his most comprehensive and devastating assault yet on the Climate Industrial Complex, Lindzen shreds every one of the fake-science arguments used by the environmentalists to justify their hugely expensive \u201cglobal warming\u201d scare story.\nThe 97% meme\nThis is a fabrication designed to make idiots feel like experts.\nAs Lindzen puts it:\nThe [\u201997 per cent of scientists believe in global warming\u2019] claim is meant to satisfy the non-expert that he or she has no need to understand the science. Mere agreement with the 97% will indicate that one is a supporter of science and superior to anyone denying disaster. This actually satisfies a psychological need for many people.\nBut, he explains, it\u2019s just a trick created by pretending that all the scientists who agree that humans make a contribution to global warming (ie almost everyone) also agree with the alarmist theory that global warming is catastrophic, unprecedented and within man\u2019s control. Which simply isn\u2019t the case.\nThe \u2018warmest years on record\u2019 meme\nAlarmists have been shrieking a lot recently that most of the hottest years on record \u2013 14 out of 15, according to the UN \u2013 have happened since 2000.\nThis is silly for a number of reasons, Lindzen explains.\nFirst, warmth is not necessarily bad or worrying thing:\nIt begins with the ridiculous presumption that any warming whatsoever (and, for that matter, any increase in CO 2 ) is bad, and proof of worse to come. We know that neither of these presumptions is true. People retire to the Sun Belt rather than to the arctic. CO 2 is pumped into greenhouses to enhance plant growth.\nSecond, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 as some idiots believe \u2013 mean that global warming hasn\u2019t paused for the last twenty years.\nOf course, if 1998 was the hottest year on record, all the subsequent years will also be among the hottest years on record. None of this contradicts the fact that the warming (ie, the increase of temperature) has ceased.\nThird, the differences in temperature are so small as to be almost unmeasurable and are open to all manner of fraudulent adjustments by politically motivated climate gatekeepers.\nThe extreme weather meme\nThe idea that we are experiencing more \u201cextreme weather\u201d events because of \u201cclimate change\u201d is plain dishonest.\nRoger Pielke, Jr. actually wrote a book detailing the fact that there is no trend in virtually any extreme event (including tornados, hurricanes, droughts, floods, etc.) with some actually decreasing. Even the UN\u2019s IPCC acknowledges that there is no basis for attributing such events to anthropogenic climate change.\nIn fact, its pure propaganda designed to scare the ignorant:\nThe claims of extreme weather transcend the usual use of misleading claims. They often amount to claims for the exact opposite of what is actually occurring. The object of the claims is simply to be as scary as possible, and if that requires claiming the opposite of the true situation, so be it.\nSea level rise\nNot a problem:\nGlobally averaged sea level appears to have been rising at the rate of about 6 inches a century for thousands of years.\nArctic sea ice\nAfter decreasing in the Arctic for a period and increasing in the Antarctic it now appears to be stabilizing. But so what?\nAll one can say, at this point, is that the behavior of arctic sea ice represents one of the numerous interesting phenomena that the earth presents us with, and for which neither the understanding nor the needed records exist. It probably pays to note that melting sea ice does not contribute to sea level rise. Moreover, man has long dreamt of the opening of this Northwest Passage. It is curious that it is now viewed with alarm.\nPolar bear meme\nI suspect that Al Gore undertook considerable focus-group research to determine the remarkable effectiveness of the notion that climate change would endanger polar bears. His use of an obviously photo shopped picture of a pathetic polar bear on an ice float suggests this.\nOcean acidification\nThis is again one of those obscure claims that sounds scary but doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. Ever since the acid rain scare, it has been realized that the public responds with alarm to anything with the word \u2018acid\u2019 in it. [\u2026] [\u2026] As usual, there is so much wrong with this claim that it takes a fairly long article to go over it all. I recommend the following source.\nDeath of coral reefs\nSomewhat exaggerated\u2026\nThe reasoned response to this [alarmist Nature] paper is provided here. As Steele, the author of the above, points out, bleaching has common causes other than warming and is far from a death sentence for corals whose capacity to recover is substantial. This article is a bit polemical, but essentially correct.\nGlobal warming as the cause of everything\nHardly anyone has the time and energy to deal with the huge number of claims. Fortunately, most are self-evidently absurd. Nation magazine recently came up with what is a bit of a champion is this regard. CO 2 , it should be noted, is hardly poisonous. On the contrary, it is essential for life on our planet and levels as high as 5000 ppm are considered safe on our submarines and on the space station (current atmospheric levels are around 400 ppm, while, due to our breathing, indoor levels can be much higher). The Nation article is typical in that it makes many bizarre claims in a brief space. It argues that a runaway greenhouse effect on Venus led to temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Of course, no one can claim that the earth is subject to such a runaway, but even on Venus, the hot surface depends primarily on the closeness of Venus to the sun and the existence of a dense sulfuric acid cloud covering the planet. Relatedly, Mars, which also has much more CO 2 than the earth, is much further from the sun and very cold. As we have seen many times already, such matters are mere details when one is in the business of scaring the public.\nLindzen\u2019s article is well worth reading in full, not only for the usefulness of its scientific rebuttals but also simply to enjoy the loftiness of the author\u2019s magisterial contempt for the entire field of climate \u201cscience.\u201d\nIt is the exasperated sigh of a hugely intelligent and well informed scientist absolutely sick to the back teeth of trying to explain the truth about climate change to audiences which have been brainwashed into drooling idiocy.\nFor over 30 years, I have been giving talks on the science of climate change. When, however, I speak to a non-expert audience, and attempt to explain such matters as climate sensitivity, the relation of global mean temperature anomaly to extreme weather, that warming has decreased profoundly for the past 18 years, etc., it is obvious that the audience\u2019s eyes are glazing over. Although I have presented evidence as to why the issue is not a catastrophe and may likely be beneficial, the response is puzzlement. I am typically asked how this is possible. After all, 97% of scientists agree, several of the hottest years on record have occurred during the past 18 years, all sorts of extremes have become more common, polar bears are disappearing, as is arctic ice, etc. In brief, there is overwhelming evidence of warming, etc. I tended to be surprised that anyone could get away with such sophistry or even downright dishonesty, but it is, unfortunately, the case that this was not evident to many of my listeners.\nLindzen does not even pretend there\u2019s a credible scientific case for the man-made global warming scare theory \u2013 because basically there just isn\u2019t one. Believing in this theory, he concludes, is as stupid as believing in magic."}

Arctic, to sustainable development and to the protection of the Arctic environment, Recognizing the rights of Arctic indigenous peoples and the unique role of the Permanent Participants within the Arctic Council, as well as the commitment to consult and cooperate in good faith with Arctic indigenous peoples and to support their meaningful engagement in Arctic Council activities, Acknowledging the contributions of local authorities, and the interests of all Arctic residents and communities in the work of the Arctic Council, Further recognizing that activities taking place outside the Arctic region, including activities occurring in Arctic States, are the main contributors to climate change effects and pollution in the Arctic, and underlining the need for action at all levels, Noting with concern that the Arctic is warming at more than twice the rate of the global average, resulting in widespread social, environmental, and economic impacts in the Arctic and worldwide, and the pressing and increasing need for mitigation and adaptation actions and to strengthen resilience, Noting the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on climate change and its implementation, and reiterating the need for global action to reduce both long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants.\nThe White House has not taken an official position yet as to whether it will stick with the Paris Agreement or withdraw, and Tillerson did not comment directly on the matter while in Alaska, the New York Times reported, despite his signing the document in favor of it.\n\u201cNo decision is

Listen, what causes climate deprivation is population. If we had not been systematically forcing women to have children they don\u2019t want or can\u2019t care for over the 500 years of patriarchy, we wouldn\u2019t have the climate problems that we have. That\u2019s the fundamental cause of climate change,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEven if the Vatican doesn\u2019t tell us that,\u201d she added.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear why Ms. Steinem limited the effects of a heavy-handed patriarchy to the last 500 years, since ancient Greece, Rome, China and India were arguably more \u201cpatriarchal\u201d than the Christian Europe of the Renaissance, but this wasn\u2019t really the core of her argument.\nThe 83-year-old Steinem has made an entire career out of fusing feminism together with the abortion industry, regularly shilling for Planned Parenthood and insisting that women will never be \u201cfully equal\u201d to men unless they have unlimited abortion rights.\nBy Steinem\u2019s definition of feminism, Ivanka Trump\u2014though a liberated, successful career woman\u2014is not a true feminist because she doesn\u2019t actively promote abortion rights.\n\u201cI have not seen her standing up and saying women should have a right to control their own bodies and decide when and whether to have children, no,\u201d Steinem said in the interview. She then proceeded to compare Ivanka to Adolf Hitler, because the maternity leave at her company is \u201conly if you physically give birth.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for adoptive parents, not for fathers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat happens to be the same policy as every authoritarian regime on Earth that I know of, including Hitler\u2019s Germany. I\u2019m not saying that she knows this, but [the Nazis] were paying women to have children. By accident, perhaps, that\u2019s her policy.\u201d\nThis was not the first time that Ms. Steinem has blamed global warming on a lack of abortion rights.\nAs the keynote speaker at a Planned Parenthood fundraiser in September 2016, Steinem reiterated the same message. \u201cForced childbirth is the single biggest cause of global warming,\u201d she proclaimed, while also discussing the connections between feminism and anti-racism.\nMoreover, in 2015, Steinem extended the blame even further in an interview with Cosmo\u2019s Prachi Gupta, declaring that the Pope and all \u201cother patriarchal religions\u201d were responsible for global warming, because they restrict women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\u201cI had this thought that we should have this massive education campaign pointing out that the Pope and all of the other patriarchal religions that dictate to women in this way, accusing them of global warming,\u201d Steinem said.\n\u201cBecause the human load on this earth is the biggest cause of global warming, and that is because of forcing women to have children they would not on their own choose to have \u2026 I\u2019m glad the Pope spoke out about global warming and it was very helpful, but does he know he\u2019s causing it?\u201d she added.\nFollow Thomas D.

It bought into the extreme environmentalist view which sees mankind as a blight on the planet rather than a blessing, and sees the industrial progress which brings jobs and prosperity as a curse.\nHere is a sample of the encyclical.\nBut a sober look at our world shows that the degree of human intervention, often in the service of business interests and consumerism, is actually making our earth less rich and beautiful, ever more limited and grey, even as technological advances and consumer goods continue to abound limitlessly. We seem to think that we can substitute an irreplaceable and irretrievable beauty with something which we have created ourselves.\nIt also took at face value all the climate scaremongering which alarmists have been dishonestly propagating these last few decades, against all scientific evidence.\nThe melting in the polar ice caps and in high altitude plains can lead to the dangerous release of methane gas, while the decomposition of frozen organic material can further increase the emission of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide pollution increases the acidification of the oceans and compromises the marine food chain.\nOne U.S. Congressman \u2013 Rep Paul Gozar \u2013 complained it made the Pope sound like a \u201cleftist politician.\u201d\nPerhaps that\u2019s because the Pope\u2019s main influence was indeed a leftist \u2013 and atheist to boot \u2013 by the name of Hans Schellnhuber.\nSchellnhuber is a Gaia-worshipping eco-loon who has previously argued that the \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d of the Earth is around 1 billion people. Since the planet is fast approaching a population 9 billion \u2013 expected by the middle of this century \u2013 this would mean that roughly eight billion of us have no place inhabiting Mother Gaia\u2019s biosphere.\nThis may be a perfectly respectable eco fascist position. But it\u2019s not necessarily what one would hope to hear from the leader of a church which still cleaves to the more traditional view that humans are a blessing and that one of their jobs is to go forth and multiply."}
{"headline": "delingpole: 'penises cause climate change'; progressives fooled by peer-reviewed hoax study", "body": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nGender studies is a fake academic industry populated by charlatans, deranged activists and gullible idiots.\nNow, a pair of enterprising hoaxers has proved it scientifically by persuading an academic journal to peer-review and publish their paper claiming that the penis is not really a male genital organ but a social construct.\nThe paper, published by Cogent Social Sciences \u2013 \u201ca multidisciplinary open access journal offering high quality peer review across the social sciences\u201d \u2013 also claims that penises are responsible for causing climate change.\nThe two hoaxers are Peter Boghossian, a full-time faculty member in the Philosophy department at Portland State University, and James Lindsay, who has a doctorate in math and a background in physics.\nThey were hoping to emulate probably the most famous academic hoax in recent years: the Sokal Hoax \u2013 named after NYU and UCL physics professor Alan Sokal \u2013 who in 1996 persuaded an academic journal called Social Text to accept a paper titled \u201cTransgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity\u201d.\nSokal\u2019s paper \u2013 comprising pages of impressive-sounding but meaningless pseudo-academic jargon \u2013 was written in part to demonstrate that humanities journals will publish pretty much anything so long as it sounds like \u201cproper leftist thought;\u201d and partly in order to send up the absurdity of so much post-modernist social science.\nSo, for this new spoof, Boghossian and Lindsay were careful to throw in lots of signifier phrases to indicate fashionable anti-male bias:\nWe intended to test the hypothesis that flattery of the academic Left\u2019s moral architecture in general, and of the moral orthodoxy in gender studies in particular, is the overwhelming determiner of publication in an academic journal in the field. That is, we sought to demonstrate that a desire for a certain moral view of the world to be validated could overcome the critical assessment required for legitimate scholarship. Particularly, we suspected that gender studies is crippled academically by an overriding almost-religious belief that maleness is the root of all evil. On the evidence, our suspicion was justified.\nThey also took care to make it completely incomprehensible.\nWe didn\u2019t try to make the paper coherent; instead, we stuffed it full of jargon (like \u201cdiscursive\u201d and \u201cisomorphism\u201d), nonsense (like arguing that hypermasculine men are both inside and outside of certain discourses at the same time), red-flag phrases (like \u201cpre-post-patriarchal society\u201d), lewd references to slang terms for the penis, insulting phrasing regarding men (including referring to some men who choose not to have children as being \u201cunable to coerce a mate\u201d), and allusions to rape (we stated that \u201cmanspreading,\u201d a complaint levied against men for sitting with their legs spread wide, is \u201cakin to raping the empty space around him\u201d). After completing the paper, we read it carefully to ensure it didn\u2019t say anything meaningful, and as neither one of us could determine what it is actually about, we deemed it a success.\nSome of it was written with the help of the Postmodern Generator \u2013 \u201ca website coded in the 1990s by Andrew Bulhak featuring an algorithm, based on NYU physicist Alan Sokal\u2019s method of hoaxing a cultural studies journal called Social Text, that returns a different fake postmodern \u2018paper\u2019 every time the page is reloaded.\u201d\nThis paragraph, for example, looks impressive but is literally meaningless:\nInasmuch as masculinity is essentially performative, so too is the conceptual penis. The penis, in the words of Judith Butler, \u201ccan only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility\u201d (Butler, 1993). The penis should not be understood as an honest expression of the performer\u2019s intent should it be presented in a performance of masculinity or hypermasculinity. Thus, the isomorphism between the conceptual penis and what\u2019s referred to throughout discursive feminist literature as \u201ctoxic hypermasculinity,\u201d is one defined upon a vector of male cultural machismo braggadocio, with the conceptual penis playing the roles of subject, object, and verb of action. The result of this trichotomy of roles is to place hypermasculine men both within and outside of competing discourses whose dynamics, as seen via post-structuralist discourse analysis, enact a systematic interplay of power in which hypermasculine men use the conceptual penis to move themselves from powerless subject positions to powerful ones (confer: Foucault, 1972).\nNone of it should have survived more than a moment\u2019s scrutiny by serious academics. But it was peer-reviewed by two experts in the field who, after suggesting only a few changes, passed it for publication:\nCogent Social Sciences eventually accepted \u201cThe Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct.\u201d The reviewers were amazingly encouraging, giving us very high marks in nearly every category. For example, one reviewer graded our thesis statement \u201csound\u201d and praised it thusly, \u201cIt capturs [sic] the issue of hypermasculinity through a multi-dimensional and nonlinear process\u201d (which we take to mean that it wanders aimlessly through many layers of jargon and nonsense). The other reviewer marked the thesis, along with the entire paper, \u201coutstanding\u201d in every applicable category. They didn\u2019t accept the paper outright, however. Cogent Social Sciences\u2019 Reviewer #2 offered us a few relatively easy fixes to make our paper \u201cbetter.\u201d We effortlessly completed them in about two hours, putting in a little more nonsense about \u201cmanspreading\u201d (which we alleged to be a cause of climate change) and \u201cdick-measuring contests.\u201d\nNo claim made in the paper was considered too ludicrous by the peer-reviewers: not even the one claiming that the penis is \u201cthe universal performative source of rape, and is the conceptual driver behind much of climate change.\u201d\nYou read that right. We argued that climate change is \u201cconceptually\u201d caused by penises. How do we defend that assertion? Like this: Destructive, unsustainable hegemonically male approaches to pressing environmental policy and action are the predictable results of a raping of nature by a male-dominated mindset. This mindset is best captured by recognizing the role of [sic] the conceptual penis holds over masculine psychology. When it is applied to our natural environment, especially virgin environments that can be cheaply despoiled for their material resources and left dilapidated and diminished when our patriarchal approaches to economic gain have stolen their inherent worth, the extrapolation of the rape culture inherent in the conceptual penis becomes clear.\nThe fact that such complete drivel was published in a social science journal, the hoaxers argue, raises serious questions about the value of fields like gender studies and the state of academic publishing generally:\n\u201cThe Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct\u201d should not have been published on its merits because it was actively written to avoid having any merits whatsoever. The paper is academically worthless nonsense.\nBut they do not hold out much hope for it having any more effect on the bullshit in the social sciences industry than Sokal\u2019s hoax did \u2013 because leftist stupidity in academe is so heavily entrenched."}

{"headline": "cohn: trump becoming \"smarter,' 'more knowledgeable' on climate change", "body": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nWhite House economic advisor Gary Cohn made the curious comment in Sicily on Friday that President Donald Trump\u2019s views on climate change were \u201cevolving.\u201d\nIt was not clear exactly what that meant. \u201cEvolution\u201d could mean moving towards the alarmist consensus of the left \u2014 or it could also mean toward a skeptical view, one more carefully informed by scientific and economic reality.\nIn political terms, \u201cevolving\u201d is usually a term used by the left, a euphemism to describe when a politician has changed his or her position. Its most significant use was in regards to President Barack Obama\u2019s views on gay marriage, which were said to have \u201cevolved\u201d from outright Christian opposition to full-throated liberal embrace.\nLike the term \u201cprogressive,\u201d the term \u201cevolution\u201d implies an improvement in moral and intellectual terms, from prejudice and ignorance to reason and enlightenment. The left, presuming that its own views are superior, and that the \u201clong arc of history\u201d bends in its direction, expects people to \u201cevolve\u201d in its direction.\nWhat was stranger were Cohn\u2019s words explaining how Trump is said to be evolving. The president, he said, was becoming \u201csmarter\u201d and becoming \u201cmore knowledgeable\u201d about the issue.\nAgain, that could mean Trump is growing skeptical of the alarmist, non-scientific view around which our public debate on climate change revolves. (In obtaining a degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard, for instance, I became more knowledgeable about the problems in modeling climate \u2014 problems that have not improved much since then, despite the radical advances in computer technology and data analysis.)\nIt is also possible that Cohn was shaping his assessment of the president\u2019s views to flatter his largely European audience, which believes in climate change the way people on other continents believe in religion.\nThat flattery may have been appropriate, for diplomatic reasons. What defies explanation is why he would imply that his boss had previously been less \u201csmart\u201d about the issue, or less well informed.\nIt is the kind of comment that tends to reinforce the false narrative the media spins about every single Republican president \u2014 i.e. that he is stupid.\nIt is also a comment that carries considerable political risk. Conservatives resent being told, usually by leftists, that their generally skeptical views on climate change are poorly informed, or \u201cdenialist.\u201d Often, the leftists making such accusations cannot actually explain themselves how climate change is presumed to take place, and never consider a view other than their own.\nFor now, conservatives continue to hold out hope that the president \u201cevolves\u201d the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement and toward a more sensible policy that uses innovation in energy technology to harness domestic resources of all kinds, and grow the U.S. economy while reducing emissions.\nJoel B.

{"headline": "jerry brown: trump's paris climate change pullout 'insane,' 'deviant behavior'", "body": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown attacked President Donald Trump for withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accords on Thursday.\n\u201cI would even say, this is an insane move by this president,\u201d Brown said on a conference call hosted by the nonprofit World Resources Institute, according to the Los Angeles Times. Brown also predicted that Americans \u201cwill not tolerate this kind of deviant behavior from the highest office in the land.\u201d\nThe Paris agreement, which was negotiated in 2015 and signed in 2016, was non-binding and was never submitted to the U.S. Senate by the Obama administration for ratification, meaning it was never the law of the land. However, critics had long argued that it would hurt the U.S. economically by committing to emissions reductions that would hurt domestic energy supplies and raise energy prices, without having any significant positive effect on climate.\nBut Brown has made climate change his signature issue, and vented his anger on Thursday \u2014 so much so that he even used the term \u201cresist\u201d to describe his opposition to Trump\u2019s policy, after earlier rejecting the left\u2019s use of the word \u201cresistance\u201d as offensive. \u201cDonald Trump has absolutely chosen the wrong course \u2026 California will resist because his effort is misguided,\u201d Brown told the conference call Thursday, according to the Sacramento Bee.\nIronically, that same day, the Democrat-controlled State Assembly rejected a bill that would extend the state\u2019s controversial cap-and-trade program. Five Democrats pulled their support at the last minute, according to the San Jose Mercury News. The bill will reportedly be reconsidered.\nOn Friday, Brown heads to China to strengthen \u201cprogressive\u201d ties \u2014 flying, of course, with an entourage and producing plenty of greenhouse gases along the way.\nMeanwhile, California has joined New York and Washington state in a new \u201cU.S. Climate Alliance\u201d that intends to obey the Paris agreement, even without national participation. \u201cThe three-state coalition aims to reduce emissions 26-28 percent from 2005 levels, meet or exceed the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan and serve as a forum to sustain existing climate programs and share best practices,\u201d according to Southern California Public Radio.\nGov. Brown argued that \u201cCalifornia\u2019s economy and America\u2019s economy are boosted by following the Paris agreement,\u201d according to Bay Area public radio station KQED \u2014 although high energy costs have been driving businesses out of the state, and businesses that have benefited from climate change policies have tended to be subsidized by the government. One such is Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who announced Thursday that he would be withdrawing from a presidential advisory council in response to Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of Paris.\nSan Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a Republican \u2014 and possible candidate for governor \u2014 reacted to the Trump administration\u2019s decision by committing his city to continue its efforts to fight climate change, though he did not explain what appreciable or measurable impact San Diego\u2019s efforts were expected to have on the global climate.\nThe Hollywood Reporter resorted to racism in its attack on Trump\u2019s decision: \u201cIt\u2019s become a depressingly regular occurrence to see a bunch of middle-aged white men in the Rose Garden celebrating yet another way to destroy years of scientific or social progress.\nIn his conclusion, the Reporter\u2018s Frank Scheck added: \u201cEver the narcissist, [President Trump] simply can\u2019t bear the thought of anyone still living on the planet after he\u2019s gone.\u201d\nJoel B.

The U.S., the world\u2019s second largest emitter of carbon, would have been required to reduce fossil fuel emissions nearly 30 percent by 2025.\nCritics of the Paris accord argue that it hurts the economy but supporters say it will create jobs down the line.

But how exactly do you issue a correction to an article which doesn\u2019t actually contain any errors?\nFor chapter and verse on why Climate Feedback\u2018s pathetic response is so utterly lame-assed, tragically stupid and wrong \u2013 as we Oxford literature graduates say \u2013 you really should read this elegant demolition by Jaime Jessop. I like her Pythonesque title: Climate Feedback Rates Dellers\u2019 Latest Effort \u2013 Not The Sceptics\u2019 Messiah, Just A Very Naughty Boy.\nJessop has done what the Climate Feedback PhDs should have done but so signally failed to do: she actually read my piece.\nShe understood that my headline was a bit naughty \u2013 \u2018Global Warming\u2019 Is A Myth Say Scientific Papers In 2017 \u2013 not because it was untrue but because it is heavily dependent on a very specific definition of the phrase \u2018Global Warming.\u2019\nThis I proceeded to explain in the body of the piece:\nBy \u201cglobal warming\u201d these papers don\u2019t, of course, mean the mild warming of around 0.8 degrees Celsius that the planet has experienced since the middle of the 19th century as the world crawled out of the Little Ice Age. Pretty much everyone, alarmists and skeptics alike, is agreed on that. Rather, they mean \u201cglobal warming\u201d in the sense that is most commonly used today by grant-troughing scientists, and huxter politicians, and scaremongering green activists, and brainwashed mainstream media (MSM) environmental correspondents. \u201cGlobal warming\u201d as in the scary, historically unprecedented, primarily man-made phenomenon which we must address urgently before the icecaps melt and the Pacific islands disappear beneath the waves and all the baby polar bears drown. What all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming \u2014 aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) \u2014 is a fake artefact.\nActually there is one mistake in the piece. Carried away by the flow of my invective, I spelt \u201chuckster\u201d wrong. But apart from that it\u2019s bang on the money. Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming theory really is a busted flush \u2013 and has been for many years. Almost all the scientific evidence indicates that this is so.\nLet me reiterate why very simply in a way you really don\u2019t need a PhD to understand.\nWe know that since about 1850 global mean temperatures have risen by about 0.8 degrees C. According to anthropogenic global warming theory, a significant proportion of this has been caused by industrial \u2013 ie man-made CO2 \u2013 and we should be worried about this because man has never been able to influence climate in such a way before.\nBut we also know that there have been times throughout history \u2013 both in the fairly well-documented last two millennia, and also much further back \u2013 when temperatures rose and fell by at least this much, sometimes in a shorter space of time.\nGiven that this is so, how can we be sure that the most recent rise is down to man-made CO2 when all the previous ones in history weren\u2019t?\nThis is one of the key planks in the argument used by climate skeptics when criticizing man-made global warming theory. It\u2019s not that they doubt the possibility that man-made CO2 might be a factor in global warming. Rather, it\u2019s simply that they have yet to see convincing evidence that proves beyond all doubt that this is the case, let alone that these modest recent increases in global temperature represent any kind of problem.\nHence the significance of those 58 scientific papers published in 2017. None of them says directly \u201cMan-made global warming is a myth.\u201d But then, they don\u2019t need to and anyway that\u2019s not how science works. They simply demonstrate in their different, slightly arid, dully rigorous, microscopic ways that climate has always been subject to natural and regional variability. From which we can in turn infer that the recent climate scaremongering is largely the invention of a handful of dishonest and politically motivated activists.\nI wasn\u2019t going to bother explaining any of this. Breitbart is now the world\u2019s biggest conservative news site, read by millions, while Climate Feedback\u2019s readership \u2013 judging by the handful of self-righteous tweets I\u2019ve received \u2013 is mainly confined to basement dwellers, Mummy\u2019s boys, weird, angry Australians and the climate science equivalent of those Japanese soldiers on remote Pacific islands who don\u2019t yet know the Emperor has surrendered.\nBut Jaime Jessop\u2019s demolition job deserves recognition for the patient and painstaking way it unravels all the rhetorical tricks used by Climate Feedback in its dishonest attempts to undermine my article.\nAlso, though I really, genuinely don\u2019t care what these loons think, I suppose it is important on some level not to let them get away with it.\nThe tricks they use are all to familiar to me because I\u2019ve encountered them many times over the years.\nI suppose, though, if you weren\u2019t aware of them, you might look at the Climate Feedback article and go: \u201cHmm. Well these guys do sound like they know what they\u2019re talking about. One\u2019s a Physical Oceanographer from the British Antarctic Survey; another\u2019s a Professor at McGill University. And there\u2019s all sorts of complicated sciency stuff in there like \u2018To see the clearest fingerprints of the extra energy added to the climate system from fossil fuel burning, you have to look at the energy content of the entire climate system over the last several decades (most of the extra energy has gone into the ocean [Levitus et al. 2012]*)\u2019 which I don\u2019t quite understand but which looks pretty impressive.\u201d\nDon\u2019t worry. This is what\u2019s known as \u201cblinding the reader with science.\u201d It\u2019s how these charlatans roll. It\u2019s only one notch up from that paper the other day about how penises cause climate change.\nJust judge my piece on what it said \u2013 not on what it didn\u2019t say but these desperate alarmists are trying to claim it did.\nWhat I said was 100 per cent accurate. Which is why these guys are so angry. They don\u2019t like it up \u2019em, do they?"}

He claimed that with pollution killing 19,000 people in the world every day, climate change is the type of national security risk that Republicans should demand government address, according to Variety.\nadvertisement\nHe said that as a Republican, he was surprised that an administration from his own party would not give him a national policy waiver on CO 2 , so that California could regulate its own air.

Americans know that a portion of that price per gallon already includes the cost of federal and state climate change subsidies.\nBut almost every American knows that Californians pay among the highest gasoline prices in the continental U.S. at $2.94 a gallon. Considering taxes and other government interventions, that essentially means that the average California household is already paying an extra $539 to subsidize fighting climate change."}

Jerry Brown holds up as a model for states and nations looking to lower carbon emissions.\nBrown's signature will add another decade of life to the state's cap-and-trade program, bolstering the Democratic governor's quest to portray California as a leader in the fight against climate change at a time when President Donald Trump is pulling back.\n\"Tonight, California stood tall and once again, boldly confronted the existential threat of our time,\" Brown said in a statement after the vote. \"Republicans and Democrats set aside their differences, came together and took courageous action. That's what good government looks like.\"\nBrown portrays the initiative, which would have ended in 2020, as essential for the survival of civilization. Extending it has been one of his highest priorities as he nears the end of his fourth term, but critics say it fails to aggressively combat pollution.\nThe legislation was fiercely opposed by some environmentalists who say it's too timid for progressive California, especially those who work to clean up the notoriously smoggy air in parts of Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and the agricultural Central Valley. Conservatives also fought the measure, saying it will raise costs in an already expensive state.\nBut Brown and Democratic leaders were able to cobble together the two-thirds support needed in both chambers to extend the law through 2030.\nCap and trade puts a limit on carbon emissions and requires polluters to obtain permits to release greenhouse gases. Some permits, known as allowances, are given away while others are auctioned, generating billions of dollars in revenue for the state.\nThe extension was part of a three-bill package, which passed. One measure aims to improve local air quality, and helped bring some Democrats on board with the cap-and-trade deal. Republicans, however, favored a third bill that may give them more of a say in how to spend the money collected through cap and trade.\nBrown sounded an apocalyptic tone in a rare personal appeal before a Senate committee last week, telling lawmakers that failing to pass the extension would lead to fires, disease and mass migration, not to mention higher costs for food and gasoline.\nRepublicans likened the bill to a tax that will hit Californians at the gas pump and the grocery store. The nonpartisan legislative analyst said last year that the existing cap and trade program accounted for an 11-cent-per-gallon increase in gasoline prices. The office has not analyzed the extension proposal.\n\"We could shut down the entire state of California and it would have absolutely no effect on the global climate,\" said Sen. Andy Vidak, a Republican from Hanford in the agricultural Central Valley. \"But what is measureable is the effect this tax will have on the poorest of the poor in my district and across California.\"\nThe bill was supported by national environmental groups and business interests, which echo Brown's refrain that cap and trade is the most affordable way for California to meet its ambitious climate goals.\nState law requires California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030 \u2014 among the most aggressive mandates for carbon reduction in the world. Without cap and trade, state regulators will be forced to enact restrictive mandates on polluters that would be burdensome for businesses and significantly more expensive for consumers, Brown said.\nThe fight over the legislation showed the divisions between environmentalists who work nationally, focusing on reducing global carbon emissions and creating a policy that can be replicated elsewhere, and environmental justice advocates who work locally.\nThe latter group said cap and trade allows polluters to keep fouling the air around major sources of pollution like oil refineries and objected to concessions Brown made to the oil industry and other polluters in a bid to win support from Republicans and moderate Democrats.\nBrown's urgency to extend a program that doesn't expire for another 2\u00bd years drew questions from some lawmakers. The governor says the move would give businesses the certainty they need to plan.\nA quick extension also would bolster Brown's global advocacy for climate action. He made a high-profile trip to China last month, plans to attend a climate summit in Germany in November and will host a climate conference next year in San Francisco."}

But it met fierce opposition from environmental justice groups that said it's riddled with giveaways to the oil industry, including too many free pollution permits.\nSchwarzenegger signed a bill in 2006 that authorized state environmental regulators to create a cap and trade program, but the authorization would have expired in 2020 without action from lawmakers.\nAfter the extension passed, Schwarzenegger highlighted the support from eight Republican lawmakers, saying they've shown that the GOP can get behind free-market solutions to climate change.\nSchwarzenegger's bill required the state to reduce its carbon emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 \u2014 a target the state is on track to meet. Legislation approved last year set a new, much more aggressive goal to reduce emissions another 40 percent by 2030.\nCap and trade puts a limit on carbon emissions and requires polluters to obtain permits to release greenhouse gases. Some permits, known as allowances, are given away while others are auctioned, generating billions of dollars in revenue for the state. The money is a key funding source for a planned high-speed train between San Francisco and Los Angeles, one of Brown's priorities.\nThe governor's office said he'll sign separate legislation tied to the cap and trade extension later this week. It includes a bill that could give Republicans more say in spending the money and another to improve efforts to monitor and clean up the air around some of the dirtiest sources of pollution, such as oil refineries."}

On certain hot and humid summer afternoons, the stench is so pervasive that it can be detected blocks away.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been a smelly mess, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d August Garbellotto, a 77-year-old Brooklyn resident who has lived his entire life within walking distance of the canal, told Fox News. \u201cSome of the things you flush away go in there.\u201d\nThe 1.8-mile-long canal, which since 1850 has been a dumping ground for the waste and heavy metals generated by nearby gas plants, chemical plants, tanneries and other industries \u2013 is one of the nation\u2019s most seriously contaminated bodies of water and has led the Environmental Protection Agency in 2010 to declare the waterway a Superfund site.\nSince then, however, the cleanup process has progressed at a glacial pace as the EPA fights with the city of New York and the companies responsible for some of the environmental damage. So far dredgers have removed some old tires and boat parts from the canal and there are plans to start scooping out the toxic sludge known as \u201cblack mayonnaise\u201d from the canal\u2019s bottom sometime in the next two years, but sewage still continues to flow into the water and locals are increasingly concerned about the health risks of living so close to the site.\n\u201cThe Gowanus Canal is one of the most densely populated toxic waste sites in the entire country,\u201d Joseph Alexiou, the author of \u201cGowanus: Brooklyn\u2019s Curious Canal,\u201d told Fox News. \u201cIn the immediate neighborhood there are approximately 30,000 to 40,000 people here.\u201d\nThe canal and the hundreds of other Superfund sites that have languished for years amid government red tape have become the major focus of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt\u2019s \u201cback to basics\u201d approach to the agency that he outlined in April during a visit to a Pennsylvania coal mine.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s very important in my estimation is that we look at what this agency does and that we actually show tremendous progress and meaningful progress with respect to those Superfund sites across the country,\u201d Pruitt told Fox News in an interview at EPA headquarters. \u201cTo reenergize that focus, to get leadership in place to focus on real progress is something that I think the American citizens deserve.\u201d\nSuperfund sites were first established by Congress in 1980 in part as a response to large-scale environmental pollution disasters like the Love Canal in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and the Valley of the Drums toxic waste site near Louisville, Ky. Since then, the number of sites designated by the federal government has ballooned to more than 1,300 despite Congress allocating about $1.26 billion of general revenue to the program each year from 2000 to 2015.\nAccording to a study conducted by the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, the number of Superfund cleanups completed each year has decreased from 88 in 1997 to just eight in 2014.\nRelated Image Expand / Collapse\nLabeling himself as an \u201cEPA originalist,\u201d Pruitt wants to narrow the focus of the agency\u2019s work to what he sees as its original mission. That means focusing efforts at Superfund, Brownfield and other polluted sites while cutting back numerous Obama-era regulations aimed at curbing climate change and allow for greater economic growth and engagement on the state level.\n\u201cThis is a matter of focus and priority,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of saying that it\u2019s unacceptable for bureaucrats in Washington D.C. to let these sites languish. This is a call to really do something about the leadership to serve Americans interest across the country.\u201d\nTo that end, Pruitt established the Superfund Task Force in May to map a new direction for the decades-old program. Earlier this week, Pruitt signed a directive on 11 specific actions that the EPA should implement to hasten the pace of cleanup at Superfund sites.\nPruitt\u2019s call to speed up the Superfund process has generally been met with positive reviews \u2013 no small feat for an EPA administrator maligned by many for his climate change skepticism and close ties to oil and gas heavyweights.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that the environmental impact is properly monitored,\u201d Mark Templeton, the director of the Abrams Environmental Law Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School, told Fox News. \u201cThe Superfund process has been very slow, so it needs to be sped up but it also needs to be done safely.\u201d\nBut there is still a concern that a rush to check off sites on the ever-expanding list could lead to shoddy work at best and, at worst, cause more environmental harm than good.\nSuperfund Stats Superfund sites were first established by Congress in 1980 in part as a response to largescale environmental pollution disasters like the Love Canal in Niagara Falls, New York and the Valley of the Drums toxic waste site near Louisville, Kentucky.\nThe number of sites designated by the federal government has ballooned to more than 1,300 despite Congress allocating about $1.26 billion of general revenue to the program each year from 2000 to 2015.\nAccording to a study conducted by the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, the number of Superfund cleanups completed each year has decreased from 88 in 1997 to just 8 in 2014.\nThat concern is magnified by Pruitt\u2019s own record prior to taking the helm at the agency. During his tenure as the Oklahoma attorney general, Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen time and also coordinated with major oil and gas producers, electric utilities and political groups with ties to the libertarian billionaires the Koch brothers to roll back environmental regulations. In his first few months at the EPA, he was instrumental in convincing President Donald Trump to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and recently challenged climate scientists to prove the threat of global warming.\nMany skeptics of Pruitt argue that the scope of the EPA has expanded since its formation in 1970 and it should now tackle issues like climate change alongside environmental cleanups.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has to be an either-or, nor should it be,\u201d Christine Todd Whitman, former President George W. Bush\u2019s first EPA administrator, told Politico. \u201cSuperfund is not the only issue for human health. Water pollution is a huge issue and very important and you need to work on it, but it\u2019s not the only issue. Air is an issue too. Even if you don\u2019t want to believe in climate change, you've got to believe that carbon and mercury are not good for you.\u201d\nWhen questioned about Whitman\u2019s comments, Pruitt said that focusing on Superfund sites was not about ignoring air or water quality, but about making progress on projects that can be completed. Pruitt argued that the Obama administration left many projects untouched and it was his job to tackle those issues.\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving forward with a positive agenda, setting clear metrics and objectives and that\u2019s far different than what the last administration did,\u201d Pruitt added. \u201cWhen I came in, there were 700 chemicals that were just waiting there for someone to make a decision on. Guess what, that backlog of chemicals is going to be gone by next month.\u201d\nOne of those issues Pruitt wants to tackle is the former USS Lead Superfund site in East Chicago, Ill.\nRelated Image Expand / Collapse\nLocated just across the state line from Chicago and along the shores of Lake Michigan, the site of the former lead smelter has left dangerously high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil of nearby low-income neighborhoods.\nResidents in East Chicago say they are particularly concerned with the safety of their drinking water, especially in light of the crisis in Flint, Michigan and want to be kept up-to-date on any of the developments at a Superfund site that has been on the EPA\u2019s \u201cworst contaminated\u201d list since 2009.\nThere is also a simmering anger in East Chicago that despite Pruitt making the site appear to be one if his top priorities, the EPA has stalled its crackdown on Indiana Harbor Coke \u2013 the company that continues to spew out illegal-amounts of lead that caused the area to gain Superfund status in the first place.\nPruitt promised that the EPA would institute better communication programs as the cleanup continues in the town and plans to take a more \u201chands-on approach\u201d in regards to the oversight of the project.\n\u201cProgress is being made there by ensuring there is safe drinking water through filters and making sure that lead is being addressed in the soil,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cThe objective is to finalize the plan, finalize what\u2019s actually going to be necessary to cleanup [the site].\u201d\nPerhaps more than the concerns of speeding up the cleanup efforts or the shift away from battling climate change, Pruitt\u2019s critics wonder where he plans to get the money to follow through on his \u201cback to basics\u201d projects given that the Trump administration has proposed cutting the agency\u2019s budget.\nRelated Image Expand / Collapse\nOne White House budget proposal that the EPA wanted aims to reduce EPA funding by more than 31 percent \u2013 eliminating several regional programs, nearly halving categorical grants and slashing funding to the Superfund program\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a budget \u2014 it\u2019s a road map for the President, EPA Administrator Pruitt and polluters to see that millions of Americans drink dirtier water, breathe more polluted air and don\u2019t have enough nutritious food to lead healthy lives,\u201d Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said in a statement back in May. \u201cWith each cut in EPA funding, each regulatory rollback, each special favor for polluters, it becomes more clear that for President Trump, public health protection is not a priority, but a target.\u201d\nThe House Appropriations Committee approved last week a spending bill that would begin the process of cutting the EPA budget, but also keep intact vital environmental programs. While the bill cuts the EPA's budget by $528 million for fiscal 2018, it is still far less than Trump had proposed.\nPruitt told detractors that the federal budget hasn\u2019t kept Superfund sites from getting cleaned up because \u201c60 percent of our portfolio approximately of Superfund sites is funded through private parties.\u201d The EPA administrator added that he will take the same approach against the companies responsible for the environmental damage that he took toward the agency when he was Oklahoma Attorney General\u2026 he\u2019ll take them to court.\n\u201cYou go to them and say \u2018look, this is what the remediation is, here\u2019s the timeline. You\u2019re responsible for paying for it and you\u2019re going to pay for it,\u2019\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cIf they say no, you\u2019re going to enforce it.\u201d\nIn the case of the Gowanus Canal, the two biggest Potentially Responsible Parties \u2013 entities accountable for the environmental damage \u2013 are the city of New York itself and utility company National Grid. The city has already committed $80 million toward that project and there is an additional $735 million for it in the 10-year capital plan, but National Grid said it plans to raise monthly heating bills in the Big Apple to help cover its share of cleanup costs.\nDespite the costs of the cleanup being covered, New York City lawmakers say that the EPA budget cuts could hinder the effort. The cuts could see 3,500 EPA employees laid off from their jobs and the shuttering of many regional programs.\n\"We don't need the federal government money to actually clean the canal, the polluters pay to clean the canal, but of course that only works if the EPA can administer the program,\" New York City Councilman Brad Lander told DNA Info. \"[EPA staff] has to be able to get the ball across the finish line \u2026 and get the cleanup underway.\""}

(The Smithsonian Institution is taxpayer-funded.)\nadvertisement\nThe content of the climate change exhibit, which opened to the public just days after Obama left office, was produced by the EPA Alumni Association, which compiled and presented it in a timeline-fashion, detailing the milestones of the regulatory agency since it was founded in 1970.\nCalled a \u201cpet project\u201d of Obama EPA administrator Gina McCarthy in an article about the museum the Washington Post published on Sunday, the museum is tucked into the lobby of the EPA Credit Union in the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center.\nThe museum does contain facts about the EPA, including that it was established by Republican President Richard Nixon and documents that the agency has put into place countless regulations affecting all aspects of American life, ranging from the cars we drive to how we heat and cool our homes.\nBut the museum also clearly embodies the ideology of Obama and his EPA, which was responsible for some of the most restrictive regulations \u2014 a number of which have now been overturned by President Donald Trump.\nThe exhibit pays homage to Obama\u2019s signing the United States onto the Paris climate accord, which has since been undone by Trump.\nThe Clean Power Plan \u2014 Obama\u2019s signature energy policy effort to regulate carbon emissions from American power plants \u2014 was also scrapped when Trump signed an executive order in March.\n\u201cThere is no question that parts of the museum reflect an Obama administration-centric narrative,\u201d the Post reported. \u201cIt includes a panel dedicated to the 2009 \u2018endangerment finding,\u2019 in which then-EPA administrator Lisa Jackson concluded that the agency was legally obligated to control greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change because they threatened public health.\u201d\nHere are some of the other items on display in the museum:\nEnvironmental Justice \u2014 \u201cIn 1994 President Bill Clinton directed federal agencies to develop environmental justice strategies to address the disproportionately high and adverse health or environmental effects of their programs on minority and low-income populations.\u201d\n\u201cClimate change is happening now. Strong evidence indicates that there are major changes in temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns that have lasted over several decades. The EPA works both to reduce the greenhouse gas pollution that causes climate change and to help communities prepare for impacts, including sea level rise, coastal flooding, changes in the length of growing seasons, and heat-related illnesses.\u201d\n\u201cFor air pollution, prevention is the cure. Using science and the law, the EPA creates policies and programs that less indoor and outdoor air pollution, greenhouse gases, acid rain, and other airborne pollutant threats to human and environmental health.\u201d\n\u201cThe EPA is exploring new ways to measure local air pollution while helping communities understand the air around them. Through the Village Green project, the EPA is building next generation air monitoring systems that also function as park benches in cities across the country. Village Green benches operate on solar and wind power and are made from recycled materials.\u201d\nIronically, it was a career EPA employee who brought the museum to the attention of the Trump administration, according to the Post.\n\u201cI wanted to make sure that they knew it existed,\u201d said Nancy Grantham, a career public affairs employee at EPA, who has toured the exhibit with at least one Trump official. \u201cThat\u2019s just how I operate. I don\u2019t like to be surprised, and I assume others don\u2019t like to be, either.\u201d\n\u201cGrantham acknowledged that the climate panels probably will be altered and possibly shelved, although she stressed that no final decisions had been made,\u201d the Post reported.\n\u201cIt should be no surprise that there may be changes,\u201d Grantham said.\nThere is at least one omission in the current exhibition:\nThe Post reported:\nEvery past EPA administrator is mentioned in the museum, with one exception: Anne Gorsuch, mother of Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, whose short and tumultuous tenure as President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first EPA administrator was marked by sharp budget cuts, rifts with career EPA employees and a scandal over the mismanagement of the Superfund cleanup program.\nAnd there is one small sign \u2014 literally \u2014 that has been placed near the entrance of the museum that shows a picture of Trump and EPA administrator Scott Pruitt.\n\u201cIn the meantime, to make sure the current administration is represented, EPA officials have installed a large poster board in the museum, highlighting the agency\u2019s new \u2018back to basics\u2019 agenda,\u201d according to the Post. \u201cIt features a picture of Pruitt shaking hands with coal miners at a Pennsylvania mine and promises \u2018sensible regulations for economic growth.\u2019\u201d"}

{"headline": "5 major takeaways from the leaked climate change report", "body": "Human activity is the dominant cause of the rapid rise in climate change, according to a leaked report.\nThe New York Times obtained a draft of the 2017 U.S. Global Change Research Program's Climate Science Special Report, assembled by federal authorities.\nThe report states that \"it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.\"\nA finalized version of the report is awaiting approval from President Trump and his administration.\nHere are five major takeaways from the report:\n1. Global temperatures are rising\nThe global average temperature increased by more than 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit (0.7 degrees Celsius) in the last 30 years.\nThe report states that average temperatures have risen faster in the past few decades than at any time in the past 1,700 years. Sixteen of the last 17 years were the warmest years on record.\n2. Significant atmospheric changes are inevitable\nIn the United States alone, the average annual temperature has increased by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since 1901. That number will only increase, according to the report.\nMore record-setting years will be routine in decades to come. Urban areas will feel the change on a more dramatic scale due to urban heat island effects.\n3. Humans are the dominant cause\nHuman activity is the dominant cause of this warming since the mid-20th century.\nThe report states that humans have caused 92 to 123 percent of the rise in temperature between 1951-2010.\nThe authors did evaluate naturally occurring atmospheric phenomena such as El Ni\u00f1o, but found that natural influence was \"limited to a small fraction of observed climate trends over decades.\"\n4. Extreme weather events are happening more frequently\nCold waves are dropping in frequency while heat waves are increasingly prevalent, the report states.\nPrecipitation extremes are also becoming more common. Heavy precipitation events have surged in the U.S. since 1901, most dramatically in the Northeast.\n\"Recent droughts and associated heat waves have reached record intensity in some regions of the United States,\" the report said.\nMore evaluation is needed to scientifically and definitively link climate change to a rise in hurricanes, tornadoes and winter storms.\n5. Oceans are rising and heating up\nOceans have been absorbing excess heat from greenhouse gas warming since the mid-20th century, the report states.\nSea levels have risen between 7-8 inches (12-21 cm) since 1900. Roughly 3 of those inches (7 cm) are from 1993 to the present.\nRelative sea level rise is predicted to be higher in the northeastern U.S. and the western Gulf of Mexico than the rest of the globe.\nSea level rise will likely \"increase the frequency and extent of extreme flooding associated with coastal storms, such as hurricanes and nor'easters,\" according to the report."}

I think it\u2019s a very serious thing.\u201d\nIn this case, Francis was referring to an article appearing in Nature magazine in June called \u201cThree Years to Safeguard our Climate.\u201d The essay was written by Christiana Figueres, vice-chair of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, along with five other authors.\nIn their article, the authors cite an earlier report which asserted that if carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise beyond 2020, or even remain level, \u201cthe temperature goals set in Paris become almost unattainable\u201d and the UN Sustainable Development Goals agreed upon in 2015 would also \u201cbe at grave risk.\u201d\nIn his evaluation of climate change, Pope Francis said: \u201cEach person has his own moral responsibility and the politicians have theirs. Let each one ask the scientists and then decide. History will judge their decisions.\u201d\nPressed further by another journalist for his opinion on why governments are so slow to act on climate change, the Pope made reference to the Bible.\n\u201cA line from the Old Testament comes to my mind: man is stupid, a stubborn one who does not see. He is the only animal that falls into the same pit twice,\u201d Francis said, although it was not immediately evident to what biblical passage he was referring.\nFollow Thomas D.

Unfortunately, we can\u2019t.\nBut despite what you hear from environmental extremists \u2013 who oppose the use of oil, coal and natural gas \u2013 even if we stopped using these fossil fuels tomorrow hurricanes would still be part of our natural world. They always have been and always will be.\nRadical greens and their political and media allies have latched onto the suffering caused by Harvey and Irma to advance their ideological jihad against fossil fuels. They want to keep these valuable resources locked up underground and never used to provide the efficient, reliable and affordable energy that makes our economy and modern life possible.\nThe extremists don\u2019t care that ending our use of fossil fuels would dramatically reduce our living standards by making energy much more scarce and expensive, or that the poor would suffer far more than the wealthy.\nMy geology, ecology and natural resources background taught me that climate change has been \u201creal\u201d throughout our planet\u2019s history, including long before humans walked the Earth.\nSome on the left are also using Harvey and Irma as yet another weapon in their non-stop attacks on President Trump, his administration, Republicans and our very way of life.\nMy geology, ecology and natural resources background taught me that climate change has been \u201creal\u201d throughout our planet\u2019s history, including long before humans walked the Earth. I\u2019ve studied climate change, spoken at length with dozens of renowned experts, and written numerous articles explaining climate, energy and environmental issues in lay terms.\nI\u2019ve learned to be humble, respectful and vigilant in the face of nature\u2019s power; to recognize that climate change can range from beneficial or benign to harmful or unbelievably destructive; and to understand that the sun and other powerful natural forces totally dwarf whatever meager powers humans might muster in attempting to control Earth\u2019s climate and weather.\nHurricane Harvey marked the end of a record 12-year absence of Category 3 to 5 hurricanes hitting the U.S. mainland. If global warming was the reason our nation is being battered by major hurricanes this year, how do you explain their absence for the past dozen years? There hasn\u2019t been such a long period when the U.S. was free of major hurricanes since 1860 to 1869.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Hurricane Research Division counts ten Category 4 and 5 monster hurricanes in the U.S. between 1920 and 1969 \u2013 but only three between 1970 and 2016, when our planet was warming more rapidly. If warming causes more severe hurricanes, the number of big storms should have been greater in the latter period and fewer in the earlier part of the 20th century.\nIf Harvey\u2019s rainfall was due to growing fossil fuel use and atmospheric carbon dioxide, how do you explain previous deluges like Hurricane Easy (45 inches in Florida in 1950), Tropical Cyclone Amelia (48 inches in Texas in 1978) and Tropical Storm Claudette (a record 43 inches in 24 hours on Alvin, Texas in 1979), when global fossil fuel use was much lower?\nNatural factors not affected by manmade climate change played a key role in enabling Harvey and Irma to strike with such devastating force.\nConsulting meteorologist Joe D\u2019Aleo notes that \u201churricanes entering Texas are almost always very wet and often stall or meander.\u201d\nWeatherBELL Analytics chief forecaster Joe Bastardi explains that a large (and predicted) cool trough trapped Harvey and kept it from moving inland, enabling the Gulf of Mexico to feed it trillions of gallons of water for days,\nIt was \u201can unusual confluence of events,\u201d said Weather Channel founder John Coleman, \u201cbut it was certainly not unprecedented.\u201d\nIf there was a \u201chuman factor\u201d in Harvey and Irma, climate alarmists need to explain exactly where it was, how big it was and what role it played. They must present hard evidence to show that fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emissions played a significant role compared to the hundreds of natural forces involved in these storms. They have done none of these things and cannot.\nThe Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico are warm enough every summer to produce major hurricanes, says climatologist Roy Spencer. But you also need other conditions that have unknown origins and mechanisms: pre-existing cyclonic circulation off the African coast, upper atmospheric calm, and sea surface temperatures that change on a cyclical basis in various regions, to name just a few.\nThe combination of all these factors \u2013 plus weather fronts and land masses along the way \u2013 determines whether a hurricane arises, how strong it gets, how long it lasts and what track it follows.\nDamage from hurricanes has certainly increased over the years. But that\u2019s because far more people now live and work in far more homes and businesses in many expensive communities along America\u2019s Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Since 1920, Greater Houston grew from 138,000 people to 5.7 million; Miami from 43,000 to 6.1 million; Tampa from 50,000 to 3 million.\nMeanwhile, hurricane death tolls have declined dramatically over the years, despite much larger populations today in areas in the path of the storms. This is thanks in part to fossil fuels that enable us to construct stronger buildings; track storms; evacuate and rescue people; and bring in water, food, clothing, and materials to rebuild.\nOur Earth is a complex, wondrous, resilient planet. But it can unleash incredible fury. Wealthy, technologically advanced nations fueled by oil, natural gas, coal and nuclear power are far better able to avoid, survive and recover from those disasters.\nPaul Driessen is senior policy analyst for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow and author of \u201cEco-Imperialism: Green Power, Black Death\u201d and other books on the environment."}

By the year 2100, the averted warming would be less than two-tenths of a degree Celsius, and the averted sea level rise would be less than 2 centimeters.\u201d\nWhile benefits from such programs would be negligible, the costs would be \u201cstaggering,\u201d Loris observes.\n\u201cBecause carbon dioxide-emitting conventional fuels meet 80 percent of America\u2019s energy needs, the tax would harm families multiple times over as energy is a necessary component for almost everything we make and do,\u201d he writes. \u201cBetween now and 2035, the country would experience an average employment shortfall of 400,000 lost jobs, a total loss of income exceeding $20,000 for a family of four, and a $2.5 trillion hit to the overall economy.\u201d\nIn other words, President Trump was right.\nIn his June 1 Rose Garden address, the President explained his reasons for withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord, noting its insignificant benefits and enormous disadvantages for the American people.\n\u201cThe Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries,\u201d Trump said, while leaving American workers and taxpayers \u201cto absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.\u201d\nCompliance with the terms of the Climate Accord, Trump noted, could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025\u2014including 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs\u2014according to the National Economic Research Associates.\nMeanwhile, even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100, Trump added.\nIn blunt language, the President said that this agreement \u201cis less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.\u201d\nIn his report, Loris concludes that the political opportunism of the moment is distracting Americans from what is important: helping the people in Houston, Florida and the islands.\n\u201cPolicymakers should focus on improving natural disaster response, resilience and preparedness.

Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you\u2019re being had.\nThe fact that Nye doesn\u2019t understand this fundamental point speaks volumes about his ineptitude as a \u201cscientific\u201d thinker.\nStill, worse is the bit on his trailer where he declares:\nThese people who are denying science then, especially, denying climate change, we can\u2019t have this. \u2026 If we raise a generation of kids that can\u2019t think critically, we are headed for trouble.\nThis is what psychologists call \u201cprojection.\u201d\nWhen it comes to denying science, no one is currently doing so more egregiously than those warmist scientists who continue to promote their alarmist narrative when there\u2019s so little evidence to support it.\nBut it\u2019s the second sentence in that paragraph that really takes the biscuit.\nAlready, thanks to the global warming scare, we have raised not one but two generations of kids who have been denied the chance to think critically. Not, as Nye suggests, because of a small bunch of skeptics who have been \u201cdenying climate change\u201d but rather because a tiny bunch of corrupt climate gatekeepers have managed to persuade teachers, media organizations, university academics, and politicians to brainwash half the world with their climate change propaganda \u2014 and to silence and ostracize anyone brave or informed enough to question it.\nHistory will judge Bill Nye as a fool and a fraud.\nBut then, his name does rhyme with \u201cBig Lie.\u201d"}
{"headline": "human-induced climate change costs us economy $240b per year, study says", "body": "A recent study by the Universal Ecological Fund, a nonprofit research organization, found that climate change has cost the United States $240 billion per year over the past decade.\nThe $240 billion includes economic losses from extreme weather events ($42 billion), economic losses from frequent weather events ($10 billion) and health costs due to air pollution caused by fossil fuel energy production ($188 billion).\nFor reference, $240 billion is 40 percent of the current growth of the United States economy and 1.2 percent of the GDP. The study predicts that this number will grow within the next decade.\nThe damages caused by extreme weather events have cost the United States more between 2007 and 2016 than any other recorded decade.\nThe study notes that extreme weather events are the result of natural causes to an extent. However, human activity can contribute to the frequency and intensity of these events.\n\u201cThe evidence is undeniable: the more fossil fuels we burn, the faster the climate continues to change,\u201d wrote the scientists who conducted the study.\nIn the 1980s, there were 21 extreme weather events that caused a minimum of $1 billion in economic losses; in the 1990s, there were 38; between 2007 and 2016, there were 92.\nOf the extreme weather events, severe storms have increased the most with a four-fold increase compared to the 1990s. Both the number of droughts and the number of flooding events have doubled since then.\nBetween 2007 and 2016, hurricanes caused $144.6 billion in economic losses, compared to $97 billion in the 1990s and $36.1 billion in the 1980s.\nIn addition to hurricanes, droughts have cost the United States economy $85.8 billion, wildfires have cost $15.5 billion and flooding events have cost $46.8. The 92 events that occurred across the United States between 2007 and 2016 caused $418.4 billion in damages.\nThe economic cost of the three major hurricanes, Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the wildfires that have spread throughout nine Western states in 2017 could be just as high as the loss from the 92 events that happened between 2006 and 2017.\nThe study predicts that, despite recent efforts combating air pollution, that the $240 billion in economic losses could increase to $360 billion per year over the next decade due to the Trump Administration\u2019s \u201cpro-coal\u201d policies and a lack of funding to combat climate change.\nConcluding with a call to action, the authors state \u201cactions we take every day where we live, where we work, where we study, how we travel, what we buy, how we build, even what we eat can contribute to climate action and make a difference.\u201d\nm"}

But you rarely hear it so trenchantly expressed by a former world leader \u2013 as it was in London yesterday by Aussie ex-Prime Minister Tony Abbott in a hard-hitting, must-read speech for the Global Warming Policy Foundation.\nadvertisement\nAbbott is one of only a handful of world leaders to have spoken out against the global warming \u201cconsensus.\u201d (The only other ones, recently, are former Czech president V\u00e1clav Klaus and, of course, President Donald Trump).\nThis gives you an idea of just how badly infected are the nations of the free world by the green virus. Even those politicians who might nurture doubts in private almost never express them in public. Abbott himself lost his job as Australia\u2019s prime minister at least in part because he was found guilty of wrongthink on climate change, which he once famously described as \u201ccrap\u201d. The man who replaced him as prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 unfondly known as the \u201cHonourable Member for Goldman Sachs\u201d \u2013 is himself a leading tentacle of the Green Blob.\nAbbott\u2019s speech \u2013 which is causing Australia\u2019s notoriously left-wing media to explode like ripe watermelons struck by hollow-point bullets \u2013 ought to serve as a painful reminder to Australia\u2019s Liberal party of the talent they lost when they decided to knife this Jesuit-trained, Oxford-educated, rock-solid, family man conservative in the back and replace him with the slippery Davos-style globalist Turnbull.\nHere are some of the highlights:\nClimate change is a product of ignorance and an anti-Christian society\nOnly societies with high levels of cultural amnesia \u2013 that have forgotten the scriptures about man created \u201cin the image and likeness of God\u201d and charged with \u201csubduing the earth and all its creatures\u201d \u2013 could have made such a religion out of it.\nThe Inquisition\nBeware the pronouncement, \u201cthe science is settled\u201d. It\u2019s the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages. Almost as bad is the claim that \u201c99 per cent of scientists believe\u201d as if scientific truth is determined by votes rather than facts.\nIf science was all about \u201cconsensus\u201d we\u2019d still be living in caves\nThe modern world, after all, is not the product of a successful search for consensus. It\u2019s what\u2019s emerged from centuries of critical enquiry and hard clash. Without the constant curiosity and endless questioning that has driven our scientists and engineers, and the constant striving for improvement that\u2019s long guided our planners and policy makers, there\u2019d be no cures for disease, no labour-saving appliances, no sanitation, no urban improvement, no votes for women, no respect for minorities; in other words, no modern world.\nGreens want to make life nasty, brutish and short\nThat may not actually bother some green activists whose ideal is an Amish existence, only without reference to God. But it should bother anyone and everyone who wants longer, safer, more comfortable and more prosperous lives.\nConsensus is not science: it\u2019s enforced ignorance\nThere are laws of physics; there are objective facts; there are moral and ethical truths. But there is almost nothing important where no further enquiry is needed. What the \u201cscience is settled\u201d brigade want is to close down investigation by equating questioning with superstition. It\u2019s an aspect of the wider weakening of the Western mind which poses such dangers to the world\u2019s future.\nWhere\u2019s the evidence for climate catastrophe? There\u2019s none in Australia, that\u2019s for sure\u2026\nContrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia, the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes, they do more damage but that\u2019s because there\u2019s more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased. More than 100 years of photography at Manly Beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent.\n\u2026But there\u2019s plenty of evidence that green lunacy is killing the Australian economy\nAustralia, for instance, has the world\u2019s largest readily available supplies of coal, gas and uranium, yet thanks to a decade of policy based more on green ideology than common sense, we can\u2019t be sure of keeping the lights on this summer; and, in the policy-induced shift from having the world\u2019s lowest power prices to amongst the highest, our manufacturing industry has lost its one, big comparative economic advantage.\nRenewables have more to do with virtue-signalling than with useful energy\nThroughout last summer, there were further blackouts and brownouts across eastern Australia requiring hundreds of millions in repairs to the plant of energy-intensive industries. Despite this, in a display of virtue signalling, to flaunt its environmental credentials (and to boost prices for its other coal-fired plants), last March the French-government part-owned multinational, Engie, closed down the giant Hazelwood coal-fired station that had supplied a quarter of Victoria\u2019s power.\nThere\u2019s a reason renewable energy is crap and it\u2019s so simple even lefties and greens should be able to understand it\nHydro aside, renewable energy should properly be referred to as intermittent and unreliable power. When the wind doesn\u2019t blow and the sun doesn\u2019t shine, the power doesn\u2019t flow. Wind and solar power are like sailing ships; cheaper than powered boats, to be sure, but we\u2019ve stopped using sail for transport because it couldn\u2019t be trusted to turn up on time. Because the weather is unpredictable, you never really know when renewable power is going to work. Its marginal cost is low but so is its reliability, so in the absence of industrial scale batteries, it always needs matching capacity from dependable coal, gas, hydro, or nuclear energy. This should always have been obvious.\nWe think we\u2019re rational but where green policy is concerned we\u2019re little better than the Aztecs\nThere\u2019s a veneer of rational calculation to emissions reduction but underneath it\u2019s about \u201cdoing the right thing\u201d. Environmentalism has managed to combine a post-socialist instinct for big government with a post-Christian nostalgia for making sacrifices in a good cause. Primitive people once killed goats to appease the volcano gods. We\u2019re more sophisticated now but are still sacrificing our industries and our living standards to the climate gods to little more effect.\nGlobal green policy in a nutshell\nI\u2019m reminded of the story of a man randomly throwing pieces of paper from the window of a train. Eventually his companion asked him why he did it. It keeps the elephants down, he said. \u201cBut there are no elephants here\u201d, his companion replied. \u201cPrecisely; it\u2019s a very successful method\u201d.\nOh and by the way, the way we\u2019re carrying on Western Civilization is on its way out\u2026\nJust a few years ago, history was supposed to have ended in the triumph of the Western liberal order. Yet far from becoming universal, Western values are less and less accepted even in the West itself. We still more or less accept that every human being is born with innate dignity; with rights, certainly, but we\u2019re less sure about the corresponding duties. We still accept the golden rule of human conduct: to treat others as we would have them treat us \u2013 or to use the Gospel formula to \u201clove your neighbour as you love yourself\u201d \u2013 but we\u2019re running on empty. In Britain and Australia, scarcely 50 per cent describe themselves as Christian, down from 90 per cent a generation back. For decades, we\u2019ve been losing our religious faith but we\u2019re fast losing our religious knowledge too. We\u2019re less a post-Christian society than a non-Christian, or even an anti-Christian one. It hasn\u2019t left us less susceptible to dogma, though, because we still need things to believe in and causes to fight for; it\u2019s just that believers can now be found for almost anything and everything.\nGood on yer, Tone!"}

While data is in its early stages, researchers say that over time, rising temperatures can lead to increased aggression, violence and depression in a region.\nDr. Susan Clayton, one of the professors on the study from Wooster College, said that while many long-term effects can only be speculated, it's likely that researchers will find more negative consequences.\n\"I think that the psychological impacts are at this point still less well-known than the geological impacts,\" Clayton said, \"but I think they\u2019re going to affect more of us and there\u2019s every reason to think that they\u2019re going to be pretty serious.\"\nClimate change can potentially have effects on both individual and community levels. On a more individual level, someone can become aggressive due to a rise in temperatures, have strained familial relationships, suffer from a loss of personal or occupational identity or suffer from depression or trauma.\nFor communities at-large, stressors can come from several sources, such as a lack of resources. Instability in an environment, from weather events like droughts or flooding, can lead to further conflict. These kinds of threats are mounting, enough that the U.S. government acknowledged earlier this year that climate change is a threat to national security.\nScientists are slowly beginning to unearth the consequences of climate change. A separate study released several months ago from University of California, Berkeley, found that a rise in temperatures was linked to almost 60,000 suicides among farmers in India over a 47-year period. Occupations that rely heavily on the environment are at the greatest risk for negative mental health effects over time.\nThere are many other potential effects that haven't been studied as well yet, Clayton said, like the long-term effects on children, or how environmental refugees will feel if they have to leave their homes.\n\"I think we rely on the environment to be a fairly stable and secure kind of thing,\" she said. \"You get used to certain patterns of weather and things you can take for granted about the place that you live.\"\n\"How does it feel when something that we expect to be stable starts to change?\"\nm"}

At the conclusion of the event, Brown joined the other politicians in signing a declaration stating that \u201chuman-induced climate change is a scientific reality, and its effective control is a moral imperative for humanity.\u201d\nIn his address, Brown said that climate change is \u201cthe biggest threat of our time\u201d after nuclear annihilation. \u201cIf we don\u2019t annihilate ourselves with nuclear bombs then it\u2019s climate change,\u201d he said.\nHe called for a crusade against the \u201cfierce opposition and blind inertia\u201d of \u201cwell-financed\u201d climate change skeptics.\n\u201cWe have very powerful opposition that, in at least my country, spends billions on trying to keep from office people such as yourselves and elect troglodytes and other deniers of the obvious science,\u201d Brown said at the conference.\nThe governor said that despite the opposition he kept a positive viewpoint, citing Italian communist leader Antonio Gramsci, who spoke of the \u201cpessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.\u201d\nDuring his Rome visit, Brown\u2014who was a Jesuit seminarian in the 1970s\u2014reportedly met with Father Adolfo Nicol\u00e1s, the superior general of the Jesuit order.\nAlthough nominally Catholic himself, Brown has been a passionate supporter of abortion-on-demand in opposition to the Catholic Church\u2019s defense of unborn children, and has called himself \u201can uncompromising champion of a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d He also supports federal funding of Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, leading Planned Parenthood to refer to him as \u201cthe REAL pro-choice candidate for governor.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, California accounts for a disproportionately high number of U.S. abortions, and although only 12 percent of the national population lives in the state, 29 percent of all the nation\u2019s abortions take place there.\nThe Vatican point man behind the workshop is Argentinian Bishop Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, the Chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.

{"headline": "german cardinal: number-one challenge facing europe is \u2018climate change\u2019", "body": "In launching an international Vatican conference on the future of Europe on Friday, German Cardinal Reinhard Marx listed off his idea of the three greatest challenges facing Europe, the first of which was \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\u201cThe European Union and all of Europe find themselves facing great challenges,\u201d the Cardinal said at a press conference Friday morning, \u201cfor which citizens expect, if not conclusive answers, at least clear objectives and prospects from their politicians and from politics.\u201d\nadvertisement\nThe Vatican forum titled \u201c(Re)thinking Europe: A Christian contribution to the future of the European Project\u201d is billed as \u201ca high level dialogue between Church and political actors\u201d and is co-organized by the Commission of the Bishops\u2019 Conferences of the European Community (COMECE) and the Holy See.\nAs the first of the three challenges on his list, Marx named: \u201cClimate change and the attendant need to change our unsustainable lifestyle in the mid-term. United to this is the problem of the costs of ecological change and their distribution.\u201d\nThe other two great challenges, Marx declared, are \u201cchanges in the world of work\u201d such as digitalization and robotics, and Europe\u2019s migrant crisis.\nIn placing \u201cclimate change\u201d as the number-one problem facing Europe, Cardinal Marx was echoing the general sentiment of the German people. A study published last August found that \u201cclimate change\u201d was the major concern of more than 70 percent of Germans, while less than half of those polled ranked mass migration as a cause for anxiety.\nCuriously, in his analysis the prelate made no mention of the deep crisis in the German Catholic Church, which has been hemorrhaging members over the past 20 years.\nAs Breitbart News reported last August, the progressive Catholic Church in Germany lost an additional 160,000 members in 2016, and 537 parishes were closed down. Since 1996, the Catholic population in Germany has shrunk from 27,533,000 to 23,582,000\u2014a decline of over 14 percent.\nThe situation of the German Church is so problematic that in 2015 Pope Francis cited statistic after statistic before a group of German bishops, asking why the Church in Germany is in freefall.\nCiting \u201ca drastic drop in Sunday Mass attendance\u201d and in the whole of Catholic sacramental life in Germany, especially in traditionally Catholic areas, the Pope wondered aloud what was going on in Germany.\n\u201cWhereas in the 1960s wherever you went almost every Catholic participated in Sunday Mass,\u201d he said, \u201cnowadays it\u2019s often less than ten percent. Fewer and fewer receive the sacraments and the Sacrament of Penance [confession] has all but disappeared.\u201d\n\u201cFewer and fewer Catholics receive the Sacrament of Confirmation or get married in church,\u201d he added, \u201cand the number of vocations to the priesthood and consecrated life is severely diminished.\u201d\nRegarding climate change, Chancellor Angela Merkel had successfully positioned Germany as an international climate leader with her ambitious \u201cEnergiewende\u201d (energy transition) program, which moves the country away from fossil fuels toward renewable, clean energy. The program also included the elimination of nuclear power by the year 2022.\nA comprehensive study published in Energy Policy in 2013, criticized the program, however, declaring that the phasing out of Germany\u2019s nuclear reactors is contradictory to the goal of the climate portion of the program, since nuclear is currently one of the cleanest and least expensive forms of energy available.\nMoreover, Energiewende has doubled electricity prices, which many analysts believe contributed to Merkel\u2019s poor showing in last month\u2019s national elections. Costs of the program now total some \u20ac650 billion, a bill that weighs heavily on the shoulders of German taxpayers.\nDespite its gusto for anti-climate change regulations, Germany has now fallen \u201chopelessly behind in meeting its carbon targets,\u201d according to reports.\nLate last year, the Germans had to be bailed out of a small energy crisis by Poland when the wind stopped blowing for several days and a thick fog covered many parts of Germany, which drove the output from renewables to just 4 percent of total demand.\nIt was coal-fueled Poland that had to rescue Germany from its self-induced energy crisis.\nFollow Thomas D.

{"headline": "african leaders once again furious that they won't get a climate change bonanza", "body": "This morning\u2019s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics.com\nadvertisement\nClimate change superstars Germany and Norway humiliated at climate change conference\nAfrican leaders once again furious that they won\u2019t get a climate change bonanza\nThe flaws in the climate change story\nClimate change superstars Germany and Norway humiliated at climate change conference\nKinshasa, the capital city of Democratic Republic of Congo, has benefited enormously from carbon emissions\nThe latest annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP23, ended on Friday accomplishing nothing but a new collection of news stories about politicians from countries around the world taking credit for climate change leadership, and expressing outrage that Donald Trump announced that he was leaving the previous climate change agreement, and thereby allowing the world to slide into planetary climate disaster.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, in particular, has been a world leader in feigned environmental concern. Years ago, she promised to close Germany\u2019s nuclear power plants, saying that they were too dangerous. She has repeatedly lambasted Trump for pulling out of the Paris climate change agreement.\nBut it now turns out that Germany is not anywhere close to meeting its CO2 emission commitments, and in fact is going backwards. Germany\u2019s carbon emissions have not declined for nearly a decade, and in fact have been increasing for the last three years.\nGermany did reduce carbon emissions in the 1990s, but even that accomplishment is dodgy. In 1991, Communist East Germany merged with West Germany to form today\u2019s Germany. East German factories were still the same ones that the Soviets had built in the 1950s when they annexed East Germany, and by 1991 those old, creaky factories were spewing huge amounts of environmental poisons, including CO2. During the 1990s, the West Germans spent huge amounts of money to modernize the East German factories, and in doing so they reduced carbon emissions.\nBut those were the easy days. The commitment to close all nuclear power plants by 2022 means that Germany\u2019s huge economy is going to depend on coal for energy, and today 40% of German energy supply is coal-based. So Merkel is going to have to do a U-turn on either nuclear-generated energy or coal-generated energy, and either way, there is no chance at all that Germany will meet its climate change commitments.\nNorway is another environmental superstar that is having similar problems. Norway, with its cold, clean, crisp Nordic climate, has always appeared to be an environmental model, if you did not count the fact that it is a major producer of oil and gas, which are its most important exports.\nIn 2015, Norway awarded oil licenses to Statoil, Chevron and other companies, allowing them to drill for oil in Norwegian waters in the Barents Sea.\nWell, Greenpeace and other environmental groups are suing Norway, saying that the awards are unconstitutional because \u201cUnder article 112 of the constitution \u2026 the Norwegian state has a duty to not hurt the climate.\u201d According to Greenpeace:\nOur goal is that the court agrees with us that licenses awarded in the Barents Sea are invalid and should be withdrawn because it violates future generations\u2019 right to a healthy environment.\nThe attorney representing Norway evoked laughter in the courtroom by saying:\nThis is a type of constitutional activism we have not seen before and that is different from our legal tradition in Norway. This is an American-style use of our judicial system. \u2026 It would stop all future oil licenses awarded off Norway and would imperil hundreds of thousands of jobs.\nWhat the examples of Germany and Norway show is that the whole climate change program is a fantasy put forth by politicians for domestic purposes. Ironically, Donald Trump is the only politician willing to tell the truth. Council on Foreign Relations and Reuters\nAfrican leaders once again furious that they won\u2019t get a climate change bonanza\nAfrican leaders were furious at last year\u2019s climate change conference because Donald Trump had unexpectedly won the US presidential election and said that he would pull out of the climate change agreement. Even so, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged a rapid scale-up in funding for climate change programs, especially to support developing countries. \u201cFinance and investment hold the key to achieving low-emissions and resilient societies,\u201d he said.\nSo now it is a year later, and there\u2019s another climate change conference, and African leaders are furious agai because there were plenty of promises made this week, but no commitments.\nAfricans claim that they are entitled to money because they are the victims of climate change. That is, the West has caused the climate change, and the Africans are suffering because of it. Augustine Njamshi from the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA) says:\nIn general, Africa has not gotten what it wanted at this Cop23. Because the discussions that matter to us, things that matter to us have been relegated to the background and all that we\u2019re hearing is what the developed countries want, and that is not in the interest of Africa. \u2026 Africa has not contributed to this [climate change] problem, yet it\u2019s bearing the consequences in a great way, in a massive way and we don\u2019t have the luxury to adapt to the climate change consequences, as well as we don\u2019t even have the means to do any mitigation.\nActually, Africa has benefited enormously from carbon emissions. At the beginning of this article, there is a picture of Kinshasa, the capital city of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). You can see the skyscrapers, apartment buildings, roads, cars, and other infrastructure made possible by research and manufacturing performed by the West. If it had not been for the West\u2019s CO2 emissions, the people of Kinshasa would still be living in thatch huts and driving around in carts pulled by donkeys and camels. Africa is as responsible as anyone else is for carbon emissions because of the enormous benefits they get.\nAnd what would happen if a huge pot of money were given to Joseph Kabila, the president of DRC, to mitigate climate change? Where would that money go? Anyone who knows anything about what is going on in Africa knows the answer. Kabila would use the money to provide support and weapons to government militias slaughtering, raping, and mutilating thousands of people in Kasai province, where 3.9 million people have already been forced to flee their homes.\nI have been writing about climate change conferences for years, and it is always been clear that they have nothing to do with mitigating any climate problems. They have only one objective: To force the United States and other western countries to pay billions of dollars to leaders of \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d countries, so that those leaders can use the money to pay their cronies, pad their bank accounts, and buy weapons to kill their enemies. I am not aware of any proposal coming out of a climate change conference that would actually reduce carbon emissions. And the examples of Germany and Norway described above illustrate this.\nHowever, the conference did produce some good news for African leaders. According to Chinese state media:\n[Xie Zhenhua] said, through donating energy conserving or renewable-energy facilities as well as climate change surveillance instruments, and promoting climate-friendly techniques, China has offered funds, technologies and capacity building to the least developed countries, small-island countries and African countries. Since 2011, Chinese government has channeled 580 million yuan (about 85 million U.S. dollars) to help other developing countries to cope with climate change, through various initiatives ranging from low-carbon and adaptation projects to capacity building activities. China has signed 32 MOUs with 28 developing countries on the donation of materials needed in battling climate change, including over 1.2 million energy-saving or solar-energy lamps, some 13,000 solar photo-voltaic power generating facilities, and over 10,000 clean stoves, among other donations. China also donated satellite monitoring facilities to help these countries with early warning of extreme weather. Moreover, China helped train thousands of climate officials as well as technicians from more than 120 countries on five continents, according to Xie.\nThe 1.2 million energy-saving or solar energy lamps donated by China should be particularly helpful to the people of Africa in mitigating the effects of climate change. At least they won\u2019t be used to kill people. Deutsche Welle and Radio France International and Xinhua\nRelated Articles\nThe flaws in the climate change story\nAs I have written in the past, you can accept all the claims by the climate change scientists that climate change is occurring, and that it is caused by human behavior. Even under all those assumptions, climate change predictions are still wrong, and have been consistently wrong for about 30 years since climate change scientists have begun making them.\nThe reason that climate predictions are consistently wrong is that climate scientists simply ignore very important issues. I have tried raising these issues with client scientists, but they simply blow me off since these issues do not fit their narrative.\nHere are two very important issues that client scientists ignore:\nOne issue is technology \u2013 how will advances in nanotechnology and biotechnology and the Singularity affect climate change? Climate scientists do not say, and how can they? There are scientists and researchers in every city in the world looking for technology solutions to the carbon emission and climate change problem. If a solution can be found, then it will be found, and no climate change agreement is needed, since the company that finds a solution stands to make a billion dollars.\nThe second issue is war. Every continent of the world has had massive wars each century for millennia that have killed half the population. That this will happen this century is 100 percent certain. If the coming world wars kill half the population through nuclear weapons, ground war, disease and famine, then how will that affect climate change? Climate scientists will not say.\nAs regular readers are aware, Generational Dynamics predicts that the world is headed for a world war that will kill billions of people through nuclear weapons, ground war, disease, and famine. Climate scientists claim that climate change is caused by human activity, and so, the large reduction in population will completely remove whatever threat the climate scientists are predicting.\nWith regard to technology, Generational Dynamics predicts that the Singularity \u2013 the point in time when computers will be more intelligent, more able, and more creative than humans \u2013 will occur around 2030. Each year, we are increasingly able to see some of the components that will bring that about. Artificial intelligence is under development in every research lab in the world, and is advancing rapidly. In particular, every military in the world is doing research on robots, vehicles and aircraft that can kill enemies without human intervention. Combine all that with 3D printing, and you can imagine a world where computer entities are more intelligent than humans, can duplicate themselves, and can fight against humans.\nEven if you do not believe in that scenario, there is no doubt that a great deal of new technology is being developed that can mitigate the climate change problem. Think about how much technology has been developed in the last 50 years, and think about how technology development is growing exponentially faster. With or without the Singularity, climate scientists have absolutely no clue what the temperature will be at the end of the century, because they have absolutely no clue what technology will be developed to mitigate it.\nRelated Articles:\nKEYS: Generational Dynamics, COP23, Climate Change Conference, Germany, Angela Merkel, Norway, Greenpeace, Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC, Kinshasa, Joseph Kabila, China, Xie Zhenhua, Artificial intelligence, Singularity\nPermanent web link to this article\nReceive daily World View columns by e-mail"}

{"headline": "california cities and crazy climate change lawsuits - do as i say, not as i do", "body": "California cities are learning the meaning of hypocrisy. They have sued Exxon and other energy companies for concealing the costs of climate change from investors and customers. But now these same cities have confessed to the markets that they have no idea whether the climate is changing and whether it will have any effect on their citizens.\nDuring the last year, Oakland, San Francisco, and several other California cities and towns took to the courts to set their own policies on global warming, even though no activity within their borders could make the slightest dent in worldwide temperatures.\nThey filed lawsuits against Exxon and more than a dozen energy companies claiming that future rises in sea levels will literally erode property values. They demand that the companies fork over millions to remedy this imminent economic calamity.\nPut aside for the moment the absurdity of pinning sole responsibility for the effects of climate change on a handful of companies. Climate change is a worldwide phenomenon to which human activity for decades, if not centuries, has contributed. Scholars continue to argue how much global temperatures will change in the future, which conduct is responsible, and whether reducing it is worth the costs in reduced economic growth. Californians have certainly not restrained themselves in the cause of climate control: they have a love affair with driving, especially Angelenos, many of whom seem to hate public transportation almost as much as they hate \u201cbig oil.\u201d\nCalifornians have certainly not restrained themselves in the cause of climate control: they have a love affair with driving, especially Angelenos, many of whom seem to hate public transportation almost as much as they hate \u201cbig oil.\u201d\nAlso put aside for a moment the factual errors in the municipalities\u2019 suits. Exxon, in particular, has acknowledged the link between fossil fuel use and climate change, supported the Paris climate agreement, and even backed a revenue-neutral carbon tax (which we did not). Yes, it is a fossil fuel company but far from concealing the truth, Exxon has been more than willing to adapt to changing climate awareness.\nCan the lawsuits even show how much Exxon has individually contributed to changes in global temperature? If San Francisco and Oakland are suing Exxon, why don\u2019t they also sue every company in China and India? The economic growth of these two developing giants no doubt has contributed far more to global warming than any American company or the United States in general.\nInstead, consider the hypocrisy laid bare this week in an Exxon court filing. It points out that many of the California towns and cities took the exact opposite position in their municipal bond offerings. When borrowing money, they took pains to insulate themselves from liabilities stemming from climate change when offering bonds to investors. Some said they had no way to predict accurately risk related to rising sea levels or climate change or simply failed to mention such risks. Apparently, these cities and towns believe it is better to tell the truth to the markets in New York City than to judges and jurors in court.\nFor example, in its bond offering in 2017, Santa Cruz states, \u201cAreas within the county may be subject to unpredictable climatic conditions, such as flood, droughts and destructive storms.\u201d And yet, in its lawsuits against the energy companies, Santa Cruz declared with righteous certainty that there is a \u201c\u2026a 98% chance that the County experiences a devastating three-foot flood before the year 2050, and a 22% chance that such a flood occurs before 2030.\u201d\nIn its 2017 bond offering, San Francisco acknowledged, \u201cThe City is unable to predict whether sea-level rise or other impacts of climate change or flooding from a major storm will occur, when they may occur, and if any such events occur, whether they will have a material adverse effect on the business operations or financial condition of the City and the local economy.\u201d But in its lawsuit, the city declared, \u201cGlobal warming-induced sea level rise is already causing flooding of low-lying areas of San Francisco\u2026\u201d\nAnd this was even before smoking marijuana became legal in California.\nThese contradictions only underscore the highly political origin and motivation of the city lawsuits. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers include Matthew Pawa, long regarded as an innovative and entrepreneurial strategist when it comes to using the court room as a substitute for the legislature to advance climate change orthodoxy. It is no coincidence that Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, a large plaintiffs firm based in Seattle, recently announced that it is expanding its environmental practice by acquiring the Pawa Law Group. Municipalities likely welcome the chance to outsource the costs of litigation to firms working on a contingency basis. Rulings by environmentalist-friendly judges could mean a big pay day for all, giving new meaning to the \u201cgreen\u201d movement.\nIn a petition filed in Texas court early this week, Exxon lays out the conflict between what the cities have told judges and what they have told the bond markets. Exxon is asking the court to require government officials to answer questions under oath about those statements. The case could have broad implications for the bond markets, as investors could have legal grounds to challenge the local governments for similar inconsistencies. In the end, the cities\u2019 mismanagement will come home to roost in higher borrowing costs and, ultimately, higher taxes for their residents."}

The issue has to become a priority.\u201d\nThe survey aimed to measure how well-informed Catholics in America are regarding levels of Christian persecution worldwide, and in certain specific areas, Catholics scored quite well.\nFor example, when asked to rank the severity of Christian persecution in 14 countries, U.S. Catholics responded with the following list of the top five countries where Christianity is most fiercely attacked: North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Pakistan. This list roughly corresponds to the most recent yearly \u201cWorld Watch List\u201d of the 50 worst countries for Christians published by the Open Doors group that has monitored global Christian persecution for decades.\nAccording to the Open Doors ranking for 2018, North Korea is the worst country for Christian persecution, followed by Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan and Pakistan. Not far behind are Eritrea, Libya, Iraq, Yemen, and Iran.\nIn his analysis of the poll, Marlin stressed the need to engage U.S. Catholics on a personal level so that they experience the persecution of their brothers and sisters as an urgent situation that involves them personally.\n\u201cWhat we hope our poll will do is show the bishops and their priests that the laity need more education and leadership to give them a stronger sense of the seriousness and pervasiveness of Christian persecution around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an obligation to raise our voice and stand up for persecuted Christians.\u201d\nIn point of fact, worldwide Christian persecution is far worse than most American Catholics realize.\nChristians are, by far, the most persecuted religious group in the world. \u201cChristians are the victims of at least 75 percent of all religiously-motivated violence and oppression,\u201d according to Aid to the Church in Need (ACN), and moreover \u201cthe extent of this persecution is largely ignored by our media.\u201d\nA minimum of 215 million Christians face severe persecution, taking the form of executions, rapes, and other forms of violence, not to mention the many other shapes this persecution takes in terms of harassment, threats to employment and personal livelihood and social ostracization.\nDuring the year 2016, some 90,000 Christians were killed for their faith across the globe, making Christians by far the most persecuted group in the world, according to a 2017 study from the Turin-based Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR).\nThe director of CESNUR, Dr. Massimo Introvigne, told Breitbart News that whereas atheistic communist regimes were the greatest persecutors of Christians in the last century, \u201cIslamic ultra-fundamentalism\u201d has taken its place as the prime agent of persecution.\n\u201cIn terms of the number of people involved, the gravity of the crimes committed and their impact, it is clear that the persecution of Christians is today worse than at any time in history,\u201d said John Pontifex, editor of ACN\u2019s most recent report.\nIn the 13 countries where Christians suffer the most intense persecution, the situation has worsened in all but one\u2014Saudi Arabia\u2014in the last two years, and conditions there have stayed the same.\n\u201cIn almost all the countries reviewed,\u201d the report read, \u201cthe oppression and violence against Christians have increased since 2015 \u2013 a development especially significant given the rate of decline in the immediate run-up to the reporting period.\u201d\nPontifex said that the \u201cPC agenda\u201d among western governments and mainstream media curtails the attention that the Christian community requires.\n\u201cThe UN and western governments send strong messages of support \u2013 but that\u2019s not matched by action,\u201d he said. \u201cTo date, the response of the UN has been too little too late.

Russian-sponsored agents funneled money to U.S. environmental organizations in an attempt to portray energy companies in a negative way and disrupt domestic energy markets,\u201d the report states.\n\u201cUpon discovering that Russia may have exploited American social media platforms to accomplish its disruptive objectives, the committee broadened the scope of its investigation,\u201d the report outlines. \u201cOn September 26, 2017, the Committee requested data from Facebook and Twitter as part of this expanded investigation.\u201d\nThe documents social media companies provided to the committee confirm Russia\u2019s influence peddling, according to the report.\nThe report also includes an article posted on the Buzzfeed News website that revealed how the Russians used Instagram to influence Native Americans on oil and gas pipelines, including the Dakota Access Pipeline, the site of Native American protests.\nSmith requested more information about Russian actvity from social media companies last October, according to the report.\n\u201cThe committee received and reviewed the companies\u2019 produced documents for evidence of Russian influence,\u201d the report states. \u201cTwitter, Facebook, and Instagram were able to identify Russian accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian company based in Saint Petersburg established by the Russian government for the purpose of deceptively using various social and traditional media platforms to advance Russian propaganda.\u201d\n\u201cThe information received from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram shows that Russian agents indeed sought to disrupt U.S. energy markets and influence domestic energy policy by exploiting American social media platforms,\u201d the report states.\nSome of the key findings of the report include:\n\u2022 Between 2015 and 2017, there were an estimated 9,097 Russian posts or tweets regarding U.S. energy policy or a current energy event on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.\nBetween 2015 and 2017, there were an estimated 4,334 IRA accounts across Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.\nAccording to information provided by Twitter, more than four percent of all IRA tweets were related to energy or environmental issues, a significant portion of content when compared to the eight percent of IRA tweets that were related to the election in the U.S.\nThe IRA targeted pipelines, fossil fuels, climate change, and other divisive issues to influence public policy in the U.S.\nThe report also reveals that Russia wants to disrupt the cutting edge technology that has resulted in an American domestic energy renaissance, including horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing or fracking.\n\u201cHorizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing as a means for producing oil and natural gas began in the early 2000s,\u201d the report states. \u201cAt that time, there were \u201capproximately 26,000 hydraulically fractured wells\u201d in the United States, which accounted for \u2018less than 7%\u2019 of all U.S. marketed natural gas. By 2011, fracking had become the primary method for oil and natural gas development in the United States.\u201d\n\u201cSince 2014, fracked wells have \u2018accounted for most of all new wells drilled and completed,\u2019\u201d the report states. \u201cThe number of fracked wells had climbed \u2018to an estimated 300,000\u2019 by 2015, and were responsible for approximately 67 percent of all U.S. natural gas output.\u201d\n\u201cIn January 2017, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report that contained \u201cclear evidence that the Kremlin is financing and choreographing anti-fracking propaganda in the United States,\u201d the report states.\nThe report also highlights how U.S. energy exports reaching the global marketplace is a threat to Russia\u2019s dominance in some of those markets. For example, according to the report, Poland recently signed a five-year agreement with the United States to import liquefied natural gas into the country \u201cin an attempt to decrease dependency on Russian energy supplies.\u201d\nClimate change is also an issue the Russians are exploiting on social media, according to the report.\nNumerous Russian posts focused on the ongoing debate about climate change by linking catastrophic weather events to climate change and divisively labeling one viewpoint as right and one as left,\u201d the report states. \u201cOne post characterizes Americans as ignoring major events that are allegedly signs of climate change. Additionally, these posts frame the conservative viewpoint regarding climate change as a \u2018liberal hoax, all in an effort to generate further domestic controversy surrounding the issue of climate change.\nThe report concludes:\nThe Committee will continue its ongoing efforts to identify foreign interference in domestic energy policy, whether from Russia or any other country so that the American people can formulate their positions based on facts rather than foreign propaganda.\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter"}

Groups like the Evangelical Environmental Network, the Evangelical Climate Initiative, and Young Evangelicals for Climate Action have adopted similar programs.\nHer street creds are good, having converted her skeptical evangelical husband to belief that human activity is driving global warming in a patient process lasting two years.\nAt the same time, Hayhoe reportedly took no questions from climate change skeptics during her talk at the Edmonton conference.\nTIME magazine named Hayhoe to their list of the 100 most influential people for her work in defending climate change, in which actor Don Cheadle praised her as \u201ca smart person who defies stereotype.\u201d\nHayhoe thinks that American\u2019s resistance to climate change has more to do with \u201cthe perceived solutions\u201d such as taxes, government legislation, and loss of personal liberty than with the theory of climate change and its causes.\nIn January of this year, author Kenneth Richard conducted a broad survey of climate change literature for 2017 and found that the alleged \u201cconsensus\u201d behind the dangers of anthropogenic global warming is not nearly as settled among climate scientists as people imagine.\nThe study revealed that during the course of the year 2017, at least 485 scientific papers were published that in some way questioned the supposed consensus regarding the perils of human CO2 emissions or the efficacy of climate models to predict the future.\nAccording to Richard\u2019s analysis, the 485 new papers underscore the \u201csignificant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes,\u201d which in turn suggests that climate science is not nearly as settled as media reports and some policymakers would have people believe.\nThe papers questioned everything from the relative role of natural mechanisms in changes to the climate system vis-\u00e0-vis increased CO2 concentrations, the allegedly \u201cunprecedented\u201d nature of modern climate phenomena such as warming, sea levels, glacier and sea ice retreat, and the efficacy and reliability of computer climate models for projecting future climate states.\nFor his part, Pope Francis has declared that humanity is currently experiencing a \u201cclimate emergency,\u201d while calling climate change skepticism \u201cperverse.\u201d\nFollow Thomas D.

I am proud that Canada is training up women negotiators so that we have more female voices around the table\u201d https://t.co/Ms3t5B0DNJ #OceanSummit pic.twitter.com/CZRpKAq13B \u2014 Catherine McKenna (@cathmckenna) March 9, 2018\nThose wondering what the possible connection could be between \u201cclimate change\u201d and gender (other than being trendy, leftwing concerns) should take comfort in knowing they are not alone. Not by a long shot. Scores of observers posted the digital equivalent of raised eyebrows, querying what the possible connection could be between the two apparently unrelated topics.\nOne representative message noted that the climate \u201caffects both males and females equally\u201d and that having more women at the table won\u2019t have any effect on what the weather does.\nMore caustic comments flipped McKenna\u2019s gender fixation on its head, suggesting that the minister\u2019s own job is fruit of \u201cgender appointed roles to made up superfluous positions.\u201d\nOne wag thought he might have deciphered the enigmatic nexus between gender and climate and Tweeted: \u201cMy sister\u2019s first job was babysitting. Mine was shoveling snowy driveways. Is that what you mean?\u201d\nAnother simply quipped: \u201cWorld ends tomorrow. Women and children affected most.\u201d\nMcKenna was tweeting from the 2018 World Ocean Summit taking place in the resort town of Canc\u00fan, Mexico, which ran this week from Wednesday through Friday. The event is sponsored by the UK-based Economist magazine.\nIn dramatic terms, event organizers describe the critical importance of the summit for the future of the seas:\n\u201cThe ocean is in trouble. Across the world, humans have effected dramatic change upon the seas. One thing is certain: our current course is unsustainable,\u201d the introduction reads.\nIn her privileged role as Minister of Climate, McKenna has been able to bring together the two issue that seemingly inspire her the most: the environment and women\u2019s concerns. Prior to working in politics, McKenna served as a board member of the Elizabeth Fry Society of Ottawa, which specializes on issues affecting women and girls in the justice system.\nIn a Facebook post Friday, McKenna underscored the many women she met during her time in Mexico.\n\u201cAt the Oceans Summit I have met and learned from many amazing women who are taking action in their community to protect our oceans,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEditor-In-Chief, Zanny Minton Beddoes and Mission Blue President, Sylvia Earle are just a few. Join us as we discuss women leadership!\u201d\nMcKenna ended her tweet with the curious hashtag #RunLikeAGirl.\nKnown to her critics as \u201cClimate Barbie,\u201d McKenna has dismissed the label as a \u201csexist insult,\u201d while even some of her fans have admitted its aptness, with Rosie Dimanno confessing that the moniker \u201ccaptures her perfectly,\u201d if one were \u201ca global warming troglodyte inclined to lob a sarcastic brickbat aimed, presumably, at McKenna\u2019s purported shallowness. A bit of mischief, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cPolitics is a rough-and-tumble business,\u201d Dimanno observed.\nOver the last few years, \u201cclimate change\u201d has become the scapegoat for nearly all of society\u2019s problems, from racism to immigration to poverty and economic inequality.\nIn 2016, the Guardian newspaper launched the improbable theory that global warming is a \u201cracist\u201d crisis, perpetrated by wealthy whites against poor, vulnerable blacks.\nWhile offering no evidence, the article makes the wildly implausible claim that \u201cBlack British Africans are 28% more likely than their white counterparts to be exposed to air pollution.\u201d\nThe following year, several news outlets accused Donald Trump of \u201cenvironmental racism,\u201d evidenced by his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. In announcing his verdict, one said, Trump has continued \u201chis war on people of color in America.\u201d\nBut gender and race are not the only issues supposedly affected by climate change.\nEnvironmental activist Leehi Yona has written that climate change is connected to an array of issues spanning from transgender justice to immigration reform.\nWriting in The Nation, Ms. Yona denounced the President for his appointment of a string of \u201cclimate-change deniers\u201d before expounding her own theory of the centrality of climate change in understanding every other issue.\n\u201cClimate change isn\u2019t just about the planet. It\u2019s about justice: racial, social, socioeconomic, reproductive, and environmental,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s about immigration reform, LGBTQIA+ rights, and religious freedom.\u201d\n\u201cI find myself unable to think of climate change on its own,\u201d Yona writes.\nThe inability to think about climate on its own, or even to be able to think about it rationally, seems to be an epidemic affecting many on the left.\nThen again, if it is an epidemic, it must be caused by climate change as well.\nFollow Thomas D.

{"headline": "rep. lamar smith: climate change and the scientific method - we should welcome new research, not resist it", "body": "Climate alarmism has become the chant of the media and liberals who favor more government regulations. As Chairman of the House Science Committee, I have challenged the alarmist rhetoric and pursued the facts about climate change.\nThe Committee follows the scientific method, which welcomes critiques, avoids exaggerated predictions, and relies on unbiased data. Unfortunately, alarmists ignore all these principles.\nThose of us who subscribe to the scientific method by questioning assertions are wrongly labeled \u201cclimate denier.\u201d So much for welcoming critiques.\nWhile I have never denied that the climate is changing, I have asked tough questions about how much the climate has changed and how much of an impact humans have had on the climate. Furthermore, I have supported technological innovation, rather than costly federal regulations and mandates, as the solution to a changing climate.\nOn the other hand, climatologist Dr. Stephen Schneider has said, \u201c\u2026we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.\u201d His message is clear: never express doubt and never accept any critiques. And the Los Angeles Times refuses to publish opinion pieces from anyone the paper deems a \u201cdenier.\u201d The paper should present both sides of controversial issues, not just their side.\nClimate alarmists seek to silence those whose research raises doubts. Instead of claiming that \u201cthe science is settled,\u201d alarmists should welcome new research that furthers the science of climate change.\nInstead of claiming that \u201cthe science is settled,\u201d alarmists should welcome new research that furthers the science of climate change.\nAlarmists also violate the second tenant of the scientific method, avoiding exaggerated predictions.\nSince the late 1970s, climate scientists have told the American people that global temperatures would increase more than one degree Celsius by 2020. However, actual satellite temperature observations do not support these predictions. Observed temperatures were less than half as high as the climate models\u2019 predictions. When the predictions are so far off, we should not make policy decisions based on them. Much more research into the complexity of changing temperatures is needed.\nFurthermore, the idea that anyone can make precise predictions of what kind of climate will exist 85 or more years from now is laughable. There is simply no way to take into consideration climate variables or technological breakthroughs.\nCommenting on the recent hurricanes, many climate scientists have tried to link these storms and climate change. But the historical record disproves them. Hurricane landfalls in the United States since 1900 are on a steady decline. The cost of damages from these storms, as a percentage of gross domestic product, is also shrinking. Even the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has affirmed that they have \u201clow confidence\u201d in climate change contributing to extreme weather.\nExamination of patterns of other extreme weather events in the United States shows that a changing climate does not increase the frequency of these events. For example, U.S. wildland fires are decreasing in frequency. The number of recorded fires in recent years is nearly one-fourth the number of fires observed in the 1970s. Climate alarmists just won\u2019t let the facts get in the way of their science fiction.\nThe third tenant of the scientific method, reliance on unbiased data, is violated by climate alarmists who present the American people with suspect data to advance a political agenda.\nFor example, some claim that the Paris Climate Accord will reduce global warming by 1.5 degrees Celsius. They have barraged the American people with this falsehood to garner support for the deal. But MIT data shows that the agreement would decrease warming only 0.16 degree Celsius by 2100 \u2013 over 80 years from now \u2013 and only if all 195 countries completely abided by the agreement.\nWhile I am sure that the alarmists will continue to shout fire when there is none, I believe the American people will call their bluff and insist that the scientific method be followed. The way to address climate change is not by increasing regulations and taxes. The future lies with research and development. Forget the alarmists\u2019 hysteria and look to technology and innovation to solve climate change challenges."}
{"headline": "delingpole: mike pompeo is a climate change skeptic and an energy realist", "body": "Trump\u2019s prospective new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is a drastic improvement on his predecessor.\nFor a start, being a skeptic, Pompeo is far less likely to undermine his president\u2019s position on energy and climate change.\nYou get a good idea of Pompeo the man, his style, and his principles from this 2013 C-Span interview.\nPompeo was Representative for Kansas at the time and sat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\nWhat he was saying back then about President Obama\u2019s disastrous climate and energy policies could have come straight out of one of Trump\u2019s campaign trail speeches:\nWhat it\u2019s [Obama\u2019s war on fossil fuels] done is to drive up the cost of energy for folks who can least afford it. And it\u2019s going to do nothing to solve one of the most enormous problems facing our country today which is jobs. It\u2019ll put folks out of work. It\u2019ll drive manufacturing to other places.\nHe went on to accuse Obama of \u201cunilateral economic disarmament,\u201d saying:\nThe United States is going to put these burdens on our companies, our small businesses and our consumers who are trying to figure out how to heat their homes in winter and cool them in summer.\nPompeo comes across in that interview as likeable, straight-talking, and well-briefed. When asked, for example, about whether the U.S. should be taking a lead on climate action he cleverly turns the question into one about energy efficiency.\nOf course, the U.S. should be trying to cut energy costs, he argues, because it makes sense for the bottom line:\nCompanies have a vested interest to reduce their costs by reducing their total energy consumption. Listen I ran a manufacturing company for a decade and a half before I came to Congress. We were every day trying to figure out how to run our machines fewer hours, make a part more quickly.\nNot just another career politican, then, but a man with hinterland who can identify with the needs and aspirations of Middle America.\nIn the same interview, on climate change, he said:\nThere are scientists who think lots of different things about climate change. There\u2019s some who think we\u2019re warming, there\u2019s some who think we\u2019re cooling, there\u2019s some who think that the last 16 years have shown a pretty stable climate environment.\nHe signed the No Climate Tax pledge organized by Americans for Prosperity.\nIn Congress he heavily opposed Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan.\nEven more promisingly and unusually, he\u2019s an ardent opponent of bat-chomping, bird-slicing, eco-crucifixes.\nHere he is in 2012, explaining why money spent on wind turbine tax credits is money wasted:\nThe wind PTC [Production Tax Credit] is an enormous government handout, and it is wrong to borrow money from future generations to give away corporate favors to those who promise jobs but\u2014as we can see now in Kansas\u2014who cannot deliver on that promise without continued reliance on other taxpayers. Most important, the wind PTC does not work. Proof of this is that the wind PTC has been in effect for two decades and, still, wind-generated electricity is multiples more expensive than other sources of electrical power. After all this federal assistance, the profit model for these companies is to take government handouts, not to produce affordable energy.\nThis is your principled, regular guy who couldn\u2019t be further removed from the sleek, smooth, plutocratic globalist and corporatist Rex Tillerson.\nTillerson, like so many Big Oil men, has bought heavily into the climate alarmist narrative. Perhaps it\u2019s cynicism: part of the \u201cgreenwashing\u201d strategy companies like Exxon, Shell, and BP used to try to buy off their environmentalist critics. Perhaps it\u2019s commercial sense: multinational corporations like Exxon are much better placed to cope with expensive, intrusive environmental regulation than their smaller competitors.\nTillerson, in other words, embodies the crony capitalist mentality of the swamp Trump promised to drain. He was never a good pick\u2014as he demonstrated by opposing Trump\u2019s perfectly sensible plan to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord.\nPompeo, we can be sure, is the right man for the job."}

{"headline": "new york times proposes taxing beef to combat climate change", "body": "The New York Times has proposed a special tax on the beef industry to compensate for the alleged damage Big Beef has caused to the environment by provoking climate change.\nIn his March 17 op-ed titled \u201cThe Case for a Carbon Tax on Beef,\u201d Richard Conniff argues that it is time to break off \u201cour collective love affair with beef\u201d because the cattle industry \u201chas a larger impact on the environment than that of any other meat or dairy product.\u201d\nMr. Conniff admits that he got the idea for a special beef tax from the French, which should already give any serious person pause. The French notoriously address every possible problem by taxing it to death, so that only the rich can avail themselves of the finer things in life.\nLast May, former President Barack Obama warned the world that eating meat was causing a dramatic rise in climate emissions.\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t as familiar with the impact of cows and methane,\u201d Obama said at a food innovation summit in Milan, adding that \u201cas people want to increase more meat consumption, that in turn is spiking the growth of greenhouse emissions coming out of the agricultural sector.\u201d\nThe growing demand for beef as people get wealthier is contributing to global pollution, Obama said, alluding to the amounts of methane gas emissions from cow herds.\n\u201cNo matter what, we are going to see an increase in meat consumption,\u201d Obama said, pointing to developing economies in China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. More advanced countries, Obama said, would have to teach people to \u201chave a smaller steak\u201d and explore reductions to their meat consumption.\nIn his Saturday op-ed, Mr. Conniff said that the agriculture sector is the third-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, after the energy and industrial sectors. Citing Chatham House, the British think tank, Conniff said that raising livestock accounts for 14.5 percent of global emissions, \u201cmore than the emissions produced from powering all the world\u2019s road vehicles, trains, ships and airplanes combined.\u201d\nAmong all livestock, cattle raised for beef and dairy products account for almost two-thirds of all livestock emissions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, he said. The 1 billion to 1.4 billion cattle worldwide\u2014at some 1,300 pounds apiece\u2014means that \u201ctheir footprint on the planet easily outweighs ours.\u201d\nIn the fall of 2016, Michael Battaglia warned in an article in The Conversation that because of the methane produced in cows\u2019 stomachs, cow belching is a much bigger problem even than the occasional flatulence that was thought to be so detrimental to the environment. \u201cDespite misconceptions, most cow methane comes from burps (90%) rather than farts (10%),\u201d he said.\nTo justify the need for a massive carbon tax on beef, Mr. Conniff apes the \u201cwidely regarded\u201d (though completely unsubstantiated) belief that global warming must be kept to under 2 degrees Celsius, since at that critical point \u201ccascading and potentially catastrophic effects of climate change could sweep across the planet.\u201d\nAs an important counterpoint, Scientific American published an essay in early March urging people to \u201cchill out\u201d over climate change, because doomsday scenarios attributed to global warming are simply false.\nThe essay, penned by John Horgan, the director of the Center for Science Writings at the Stevens Institute of Technology, analyzed two reports by \u201cecomodernists\u201d who reject climate panic and frame the question of climate change and humanity\u2019s ability to cope with it in radically new terms.\nOne of the reports, a work called \u201cEnlightened Environmentalism\u201d by Harvard iconoclast Steven Pinker, criticized \u201cthe mainstream environmental movement, and the radicalism and fatalism it encourages,\u201d arguing that humanity can solve problems related to climate change the same way it has solved myriad other problems, by harnessing \u201cthe benevolent forces of modernity.\u201d\nThe second report is a recent article by Will Boisvert titled \u201cThe Conquest of Climate,\u201d which contends that the \u201cconsequences for human well-being will be small\u201d even if human greenhouse emissions significantly warm the planet.\nUndaunted, Mr. Conniff declares that a carbon tax on beef would be \u201conly a little painful,\u201d since people could learn to skip the beef and \u201csubstitute other meats, like pork and chicken, that have a much smaller climate change footprint.\u201d\nIn the end, one remains with the lingering suspicion that rather than addressing real problems, the left feels compelled to invent false ones, for the simple pleasure of proposing how government can tell people how to live.\nSocial engineering never truly dies. It just grazes in new pastures.\nFollow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsrome"}

{"headline": "delingpole: 'climate change will kill as many people as 25 holocausts'", "body": "Climate change is going to kill at least 150 million people and there\u2019s nothing we can do to stop it.\nWell, at least it is if you believe climate doomster David Wallace-Wells in the latest issue of New York magazine. Things are bad. Really bad. We didn\u2019t listen and now we can expect to pay a terrible price \u2014 starting with all those deaths:\nNumbers that large can be hard to grasp, but 150 million is the equivalent of 25 Holocausts. It is five times the size of the death toll of the Great Leap Forward \u2014 the largest non-military death toll humanity has ever produced. It is three times the greatest death toll of any kind: World War II.\nThis is not Wallace-Wells\u2019s first foray into climate disaster pornography.\nLast year, he published an essay called The Uninhabitable Earth \u2014 a 7,000-word compendium of climate terror hailed by one overawed leftist commentator as \u201cthe Silent Spring of our time\u201d and praised by activists including Michael Mann but widely mocked by more sane people for its absurd and hysterical predictions.\nWallace-Wells warned that a sixth mass extinction could wipe out 97 percent of the planet\u2019s population; that Bangladesh and Miami would be drowned; that almost everywhere would become hotter than the Middle East; that terrifying diseases would be released from the ice; that there would be no more hamburgers.\nNow Wallace-Wells has toned down his disaster predictions slightly. Though 150 million people is indeed a lot of deaths \u2014 \u201c25 Holocausts,\u201d as he reminds us \u2014 it\u2019s still some way short of the seven billion or more who would die if his original prediction ever came true.\nWhat\u2019s worrying about that 150 million figure, though, is that it comes from an actual science paper, published by tenured scientists. The lead author is one Drew Shindell, Nicholas Professor of Earth Sciences at Duke University. His paper \u2014 \u201cQuantified, localized health benefits of accelerated carbon dioxide emissions reductions\u201d \u2014 was published in Nature Climate Change.\nWhen I say \u201cworrying,\u201d what I mean is this: you paid for this nonsense; worse still, if you\u2019ve got kids at Duke, this guy could actually be teaching them.\nHere \u2014 your tax dollar at work \u2014 is part of the abstract:\nWe therefore examine the human health benefits of increasing 21st-century CO2 reductions by 180 GtC, an amount that would shift a \u2018standard\u2019 2 \u00b0C scenario to 1.5 \u00b0C or could achieve 2 \u00b0C without negative emissions. The decreased air pollution leads to 153 \u00b1 43 million fewer premature deaths worldwide, with ~40% occurring during the next 40 years, and minimal climate disbenefits. More than a million premature deaths would be prevented in many metro-politan areas in Asia and Africa, and 200,000 in individual urban areas on every inhabited continent except Australia.\nYou really don\u2019t need a PhD in bullshit to realize that this is weapons-grade, copper-bottomed drivel. Like pretty much every paper ever published by the climate alarmism industry, all the scary predictions are merely projections based on modeled scenarios dependent on so many dubious assumptions that their conclusions are objectively worthless.\nHere, translated into English, is what this report is basically saying: if only we can keep global warming down to 1.5 \u00b0C, then 150 million lives will be saved.\nBut what, you might reasonably ask, is going to kill all these people if we don\u2019t keep global warming down to 1.5 \u00b0C?\nWell may you wonder. It\u2019s not like carbon dioxide is a poison at current atmospheric concentrations. Even if we doubled it, it would still be considerably less than is pumped into commercial glasshouses by fruit growers. What Shindell et al appear to have done is conflate CO2 with more general pollution and just assumed all those millions of people will die of lung disease.\nIndeed, even the hysterical Wallace-Wells is forced to concede that these figures are, ahem, speculative:\nThe paper\u2019s math is speculative, of course, and there will surely be those who take issue with its methodology.\nStill, what\u2019s good about Wallace-Wells\u2019s article is that it suggests that radical environmentalists \u2014 some of them, anyway \u2014 are finally waking up to the fact that their goals are unachievable.\nThey want the world to \u201cdecarbonize,\u201d to adopt the renewables they pretend are \u201cclean\u201d (ignoring all the millions of birds and bats they slice and dice, all the countryside they ruin), to abandon the fossil fuels they claim are \u201cunsustainable.\u201d\nBut the fact is that the vast majority of humanity just don\u2019t give a damn. Environmentalism is just a niche obsession of a few loons.\nThis has been the main lesson of the Paris Climate Accord. Delegates from nearly 200 countries turned up and made all the right virtue-signaling noises. But when push came to shove, not one of them was prepared to prioritize \u201ccombatting climate change\u201d over the economic well-being of their people.\nHere is Wallace-Wells\u2019s take:\nTo keep the planet under two degrees of warming \u2014 a level that was, not all that long ago, defined as the threshold of climate catastrophe \u2014 all signatory nations have to match or better those commitments. There are 195 signatories, of which only the following are considered even \u201cin range\u201d of their Paris targets: Morocco, Gambia, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, India, and the Philippines. This puts Donald Trump\u2019s commitment to withdraw from the treaty in a useful perspective; in fact, his spite may ultimately prove perversely productive, since the evacuation of American leadership on climate seems to have mobilized China, eager to claim the mantle and far more consequential to the future of the planet because of its size and relative poverty, to adopt a much more aggressive posture toward climate.\nThe stuff at the end about China taking the environmental lead is risible. The Chinese don\u2019t give a damn about \u201cclimate change.\u201d But the rest is pretty much spot on.\nMind you, you could have read this two years ago at Breitbart. The Paris Climate Accord was the worst deal in history: $1.5 trillion (at a conservative estimate) to avert global warming by perhaps 1/20th of a degree C.\nScience is never going to solve climate change because it was a never a scientific issue in the first place.\nUltimately it will be decided by economics. In fact, it already has been. No matter what amount of bull children are fed by their teachers, no matter how much green propaganda gets invented by scientists, tweaked by NGOs and disseminated by a compliant media, the brutal fact remains that the people of the world have long since made up their mind about \u201cclimate change.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a scam and they\u2019re just not buying it."}
{"headline": "fewer republicans and independents fear 'climate change'; more democrats do...", "body": "Fewer and fewer Republicans and Independents believe that \u2018climate change\u2019 is a credible threat; more and more Democrats do. \u2018Global warming\u2019, it is becoming increasingly clear, is a political issue and not a scientific one.\nThis shift is shown in the latest Gallup survey:\nHere are some of the findings:\nNinety-one percent of Democrats and 33% of Republicans say they worry a great deal or fair amount about global warming, but 67% of Republicans worry only a little or not at all.\nWhile 82% of Democrats think global warming has already begun to happen, only 34% of Republicans agree. Rather, 57% of Republicans think it will not happen in their lifetime (25%) or will \u201cnever happen\u201d (32%).\nAbout seven in 10 Republicans (69%) think the seriousness of global warming is exaggerated in the news, 15% think it is generally correct and 15% say it is generally underestimated. Democrats, however, are much more likely to think the seriousness of global warming is underestimated (64%) or correct (32%), and just 4% say it is exaggerated.\nEighty-six percent of Democrats versus 42% of Republicans think most scientists believe global warming is occurring. The percentage of Republicans who say most scientists believe this is down 11 percentage points since last year.\nAlmost nine in 10 Democrats say increases in the Earth\u2019s temperature over the last century are due to human activities more than natural changes in the environment. Just 35% of Republicans agree, while 63% attribute the temperature increases to natural environmental causes.\nFour in five Republicans do not think global warming will pose a serious threat to them in their lifetime; two-thirds of Democrats think it will.\nIn other words, if you voted for Donald Trump you probably share his skeptical position on global warming. And if you didn\u2019t vote for Donald Trump, you can barely sleep at night for the constant nagging worry that there\u2019s a guy in the White House who denies the existence of a problem you just know is a major threat.\nSince nothing has happened scientifically between 2017 and 2018 to strengthen the case for man-made global warming, the only logical conclusion of this increased divergence between voters\u2019 views is that it\u2019s all down to politics. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord will, depending on your political allegiance, either have hardened your skepticism or increased your sense of impending doom.\nThis is good news for skeptics. It confirms what we\u2019ve been saying all along: global warming is really just another attempted leftist takeover by the watermelons \u2013 green on the outside, red on the inside."}

The overconfident alarmists appear to have bitten off more than they can chew. They imagined that they\u2019d fool the world into thinking that this was a case about ordinary, wronged citizens \u2013 specifically the cities of San Francisco and neighboring Oakland \u2013 taking on the evil, sea-level-raising, planet-destroying might of Big Oil.\nIn reality, as is becoming clearer by the day, it\u2019s the \u201cscience\u201d of climate change which is really on trial here. And given that the \u201cscience\u201d of climate change is so shaky that it might as well be called \u201cwitchcraft\u201d this is not a discussion that\u2019s likely to end well for the shysters who are promoting it\u2026\nBackground\nThe origins of this case lie in #Exxonknew. Its purpose is to attack the fossil fuel industry using much the same methods once employed against the tobacco industry. The plan was dreamed up in 2012 by a small group of climate activists meeting in La Jolla, California.\nThe cities of San Francisco and Oakland are suing five Big Oil firms \u2013 Chevron, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell \u2013 alleging that they have conspired, Big-Tobacco-style, to conceal the harm of their products. Apparently, these oil majors ought to be compelled to pay billions of dollars in compensation for the damage they have done, inter alia by causing sea levels to rise.\nThe Judge\nAlready, the plaintiffs have run into a major problem. Judge William Alsup \u2013 who by rights really ought to have been one of their guys, given that he\u2019s a Clinton appointment who lives in California \u2013 turns out to be the real deal. As this excellent overview by Tony Thomas in Quadrant notes, he has a reputation for not just taking anybody\u2019s word for it:\nWhile presiding in Uber v. Waymo, for example, he asked for a tutorial on self-driving car technology. In Oracle v. Google, he taught himself some Java programming language, to help understand the case.\nThe very last thing the plaintiffs needed was a judge who does his homework. They needed one who would take their junk science at face value.\nAlready, Judge Alsup has pretty much dismissed the Exxonknew conspiracy theory. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, and feel free to send me other documentation, but all I\u2019ve seen so far is that someone [from an oil major] went to the IPCC conference and took notes. That\u2019s not a conspiracy,\u201d he saidl.\nThis does not augur well for the plaintiffs.\nBig Oil\nThe oil majors have been about as helpful as a chocolate fireguard in this case. You\u2019d think that with all those billions, they\u2019d have a little to set aside to make a decent fight in defense of their own industry. But in fact, for reasons ranging from cowardice to convenience to cynicism, most of them are heavily invested in the alarmist cause. Exxon\u2019s Rex Tillerson wanted the U.S. to stay in the Paris Climate Accord; Shell\u2019s CEO Ben Van Beurden is a veritable Uriah Heep when it comes to grovelling about the evils of his industry; BP once tried to rebrand itself \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d lest anyone confuse it with a company whose business model depended on extracting sticky black stuff from the ground.\nWhen the judge asked the various parties to give him a tutorial on climate change, only Chevron bothered to do so. Instead, most of the best scientific arguments have been made for them by skeptics offering amicus curiae \u2013 \u2018friends of the court\u2019 \u2013 briefs. Despite what you hear claimed by climate alarmists, skeptics receive little if any financial support from the oil industry because the oil industry just doesn\u2019t want the flak \u2013 and it knows that skeptics are so committed to their cause they\u2019re prepared to say this stuff for free, so why bother?\nThe Skeptics\nOne amicus curiae team, supported by the Heartland Institute, comprises Christopher Monckton, Willie Soon, David Legates and William Briggs. Here is a transcript of their brief. And here \u2013 courtesy of Quadrant \u2013 is a short summary:\nThere is no \u201cconsensus\u201d among scientists that recent global warming was chiefly anthropogenic, still less that unmitigated anthropogenic warming has been or will be dangerous or catastrophic \u2026 Even if it be assumed [for the sake of argument] that all of the 0.8 degC global warming since anthropogenic influence first became potentially significant in 1950 was attributable to us, in the present century little more than 1.2 degC of global warming is to be expected, not the 3.3 degC that the IPCC had predicted.\nThe other team comprises William Happer, Steven Koonin and Richard Lindzen. Here is a summary of their argument:\nThe climate is always changing; changes like those of the past half-century are common in the geologic record, driven by powerful natural phenomena Human influences on the climate are a small (1%) perturbation to natural energy flows It is not possible to tell how much of the modest recent warming can be ascribed to human influences There have been no detrimental changes observed in the most salient climate variables and today\u2019s projections of future changes are highly uncertain\nThe Alarmists\nThese people have two major problems: a) they\u2019re not intellectually in the same league as the skeptics and b) the science just doesn\u2019t support them.\nThe Warmist team\u2019s leading academic is Professor Myles Allen of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University. This sounds impressive. But he didn\u2019t do himself many favors when at one point, he told the court \u201cNow oxygen is almost 29 percent of the atmosphere.\u201d OK, so perhaps he was just having a Condor moment (the correct figure is 21 percent). His bigger difficulty is that his argument for the existence of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming theory is riddled with omissions and inaccuracies which are cruelly exposed here.\nAllen\u2019s presentation, for example, made much of Svante Arrhenius, the Swedish chemist who posited that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would cause \u201cglobal warming\u201d (though Arrhenius considered this to be a good thing, not a bad thing). But our understanding of climate change has moved on since then, not least in the recognition that water vapor is a far more significant greenhouse gas than CO2.\nAs his anonymous demolisher notes on the blog:\nDr. Myles Allen points out that CO2 is potent relative to the non-GHGs of O2 and N2, but fails to address H2O. That is like claiming an aspirin cured the pain AFTER being given a huge dose of morphine, and never mentioning the morphine.\nThere is much more in this scathing vein, such as this dismissal of Allen\u2019s claim to the court that carbon dioxide is rising to levels not seen for 20 million years:\nCherry picking at its best. CO2 has been as high as 7,000 ppm and NEVER caused catastrophic warming or ocean acidification. Life has thrived through all levels of atmospheric CO2. Coral Reefs formed during periods where there was much higher CO2. The globe fell into an ice age when CO2 was 4,000 ppm, 10x what it is today. BTW, plants die when CO2 falls below 180 ppm. We are near the lowest level in geological history for CO2, and we are dangerously close to the level where plants starve to death. Warming is infinitely preferable to an ice age. Funny how Dr. Myles Allen forgot to include the longer-term CO2 graphic. BTW, that CO2 graphic follows standard of living far better than temperatures.\nThe bottom line is, if you\u2019re going to duke it out on the science, you\u2019d better make damn sure that your science is better than your opponent\u2019s science. In the Alarmists\u2019 case this just isn\u2019t an option.\nNever Get Into A Fight You Can\u2019t Win\nUp till now the Alarmists have understood this. It\u2019s why they roll the way they do, preferring to use the Appeal to Authority (and underhand bullying and smearing attacks) rather than engage skeptics in public debate. Whenever they\u2019ve done the latter, they\u2019ve tended to lose \u2013 as Tony Thomas notes at Quadrant.\n\u201cDo not debate!\u201d has been warmist policy ever since their talent was trounced by the sceptic team in a two-hour New York public debate at Radio City Hall in 2007.[7]The audience initially polled 57.3% to 29.9% for a \u201cGlobal Warming Crisis\u201d, but after the debate that flipped 46.2% to 42.2% in favour of the sceptics. US warmist \u201cexperts\u201d subsequently refused even to share platforms with sceptic rivals if informed critics of their shtick are given equal standing. In March, 2013, Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA/GISS climate group, fled the TV interview room (from 6.20 mins) when he learned Roy Spencer, an expert on earth temperature readings from satellite, was arriving and would subject him to questions. A year later Dan Weiss, the director of climate strategy at the liberal Center for American Progress, did an equivalent runner rather than face sceptic Marc Morano in debate, as did Hollywood icon and \u201cTitanic\u201d director James Cameron in 2010. In a recent exception, warmist Jon Christensen (UCal LA) and sceptic Willie Soon (Harvard) went head to head at a Comedy Club in Los Angeles in January. The result was not scored but the audience jeered whenever Christensen denied California\u2019s soaring power prices were hurting low-income families.\nThis attempt by alarmists to take on five oil majors smacks of hubris. Or desperation. Or suicidal complacency. Or perhaps a mix of all three. Because the alarmist position happens also to be the longstanding establishment position, it\u2019s possible that they have been lulled into forgetting just how weak their case actually is.\nThe Exxonknew trial belongs to another era: the one before Donald Trump came along and drove a coach and horses through the so-called climate \u201cconsensus.\u201d\nThis cannot end well for the Alarmists who brought this dishonest, vexatious, and expensive case.\nWhat did they think they were playing at?"}

Conveniently, these money-hungry mayors and their equally greedy trial lawyers accuse only the largest, most profitable oil and natural gas companies of wrongdoing.\nTheir municipal lawsuits allege that global warming is a local, \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d issue and the sole perpetrators of our planet\u2019s \u201cwarming\u201d are no farther away than the local refinery or natural gas plant. Sound unfair? Add this insane reasoning to the fact that dozens of other industrialized nations are apparently blameless for any of the planet\u2019s climate-related woes. Operators of airlines, asphalt factories, cement plants, auto dealerships and heavy machinery in New York or California are likewise off the hook for any climate change-related issues.\nThese lefty mayors suggest that because the earth\u2019s climate is changing, they might incur expenses years down the road for possible sea level rise, storms, etc., so they want our oil and natural gas producers to pay hundreds of billions in undefined damages.\nA U.S. district judge in California scheduled a hearing to listen to both sides of the debate in a \u201ctutorial\u201d on climate change. While the energy industry presented logical facts, trial lawyers representing these liberal metropolises offered a tried-and-failed retread of legal claptrap. Importantly, the judge dismissed the notion of a conspiracy by energy companies to suppress global warming science. Referring to one of the documents he reviewed, the judge said, \u201cI read that paragraph 67 the same way; that there was a conspiratorial document within the defendants about how they knew good and well that global warming was right around the corner. And I said: \u2018Okay. That's going to be a big thing. I want to see it.\u2019 Well, it turned out it wasn't quite that.\u201d\nIn 2011, six Midwest power companies faced the same legal nonsense. The cases were tossed by the U.S Supreme Court, with liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg writing the majority opinion in the 8-to-0 decision.\nA few years ago, several liberal state attorneys general attempted to sue Exxon for alleged damages associated with climate change, attracting fawning praise from the liberal press. But headlines often fall short of actual facts in court and in every claim, the state AG\u2019s quietly retreated from their cases or let them fall inactive.\nIn 2011, six Midwest power companies faced the same legal nonsense. The cases were tossed by the U.S Supreme Court. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in the 8-to-0 decision which ruled that American corporations cannot be sued under local \u201cnuisance\u201d ordinances regarding greenhouse gas emissions as the climate change issue falls under the jurisdiction of Congress and the EPA, which, according to Ginsburg, are \u201cbetter equipped to do the job than individual district judges issuing ad hoc, case-by-case decisions.\u201d Ginsburg warned that turning the jurisdiction of climate change over to local courts would create a quagmire of dissenting legal opinions across the country and allow an individual district judge to become a \u201csuper EPA.\u201d\nThe truth is America should embrace its energy industry and halt these unfounded efforts to sabotage our vital energy sector. The surge of American shale oil and natural gas production has fundamentally improved the U.S. economy and led the way in lowering CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases.\nIn 2005, after the nation\u2019s shale drilling revolution began, C02 emissions began to fall. U.S. energy-related carbon emissions fell 14 percent below the 2005 level in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). It wasn\u2019t due to renewable fuels that still represent less than 5 percent of our national energy grid. Our nation\u2019s drop in C02 emissions came as our manufacturing and energy sectors began a decisive shift toward natural gas. The market\u2019s move to relatively clean-burning natural gas has been so profound that even if Barack Obama had never decreed the Clean Power Plan, the United States would have already met the CPP\u2019s carbon dioxide reduction target for 2025, according to a recent Carnegie Mellon University report.\nOur U.S. oil and gas industry has invested $90 billion on emission control technologies between 2000 to 2014, according to a report by T2 and Associates. Just between 2013 and 2014 alone, the industry directly reduced emissions by the equivalent of 55.5 million metric tons of CO2 \u2013 equal to taking 11.8 million cars off of the road. Methane emissions from venting and flaring associated with onshore petroleum production declined 40 percent just between 2015 and 2016, according to a new EPA report. The five biggest energy companies -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp., BP Plc and Total SA -- collectively curbed combined emissions an average of 13 percent between 2010 and 2015, according to a report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\nThese city officials should face securities fraud charges because they\u2019ve been caught telling bond investors how any risks associated with climate change in their cities are hardly measurable, while in court they argue how the sky is falling. Sadly, this matter will likely have to go back to the Supreme Court after the left leaning 9th Circuit Court of Appeals surprised no one by allowing these state-by-state cases to advance.\nIn the meantime, our energy producers will have to fend off more groundless charges as they work to provide affordable, reliable energy for us all."}

{"headline": "delingpole: government watchdog reprimands bbc for telling truth about climate change", "body": "In the U.S. \u2013 thanks largely to Donald Trump \u2013 the skeptics are winning the climate argument.\nBut in the rest of the Western world, skeptics are losing big time because, increasingly, their voices are being censored. Nowhere is this more painfully true than in the UK, where the BBC has now officially been reprimanded by a state watchdog for telling the truth about climate change.\nNo really. It sounds absurd to the point of lunacy. But this is what Ofcom \u2013 Britain\u2019s state regulator of broadcast media \u2013 has done in its latest ruling.\nThe BBC had run a radio interview in August 2017 with a climate skeptic \u2013 Lord Lawson (formerly Chancellor of the Exchequer under Margaret Thatcher). Lord Lawson made several statements about climate change, all but one of them entirely accurate.\nThese included:\n\u201cWe do have in this country, in England, one of the highest energy costs in the world\u201d\nand\n[in response to interviewers\u2019 \u201cThe point Al Gore makes is that we subsidise all energy, including fossil fuel energy\u201d] \u201cNo we don\u2019t. That\u2019s not true. We tax fossil fuel energy. Anyway, we subsidise renewable energy\u201d.\nComplaints were made by a person or persons unknown and Ofcom investigated. It decided, grudgingly, that the above claims were defensible.\nIt ruled, however, that two of Lord Lawson\u2019s other statements represented a \u201cbreach of standards.\u201d\nThese were:\n\u2022 \u201call the experts say there hasn\u2019t been\u201d an increase in extreme weather events and that the IPCC \u201cconcedes\u201d this fact \u2022 according to the official figures, \u201cduring this past 10 years\u2026 average world temperature has slightly declined\u201d.\nNow the second of these two statements is indeed incorrect \u2013 a misspeak, you might say \u2013 for which Lord Lawson subsequently apologised. Sure there is a case to be made that global warming has been subject to a 20 year \u201cPause\u201d, which none of the alarmists\u2019 computer models predicted. Unfortunately, in the heat of the moment, Lawson picked an unfortunate timescale on which to base this point.\nBut the first of these statements is entirely correct. And it\u2019s not evil, cackling, climate change deniers in the pay of Big Oil who are saying this. It\u2019s the impeccably alarmist IPCC which Lord Lawson was quoting.\nHere, as per Roger Pielke Jr, is what the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report says about \u201cextreme weather\u201d and global warming:\n\u201cOverall, the most robust global changes in climate extremes are seen in measures of daily temperature, including to some extent, heat waves. Precipitation extremes also appear to be increasing, but there is large spatial variability\u201d\n\u201cThere is limited evidence of changes in extremes associated with other climate variables since the mid-20th century\u201d\n\u201cCurrent datasets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century \u2026 No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin\u201d\n\u201cIn summary, there continues to be a lack of evidence and thus low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and/or frequency of floods on a global scale\u201d\n\u201cIn summary, there is low confidence in observed trends in small-scale severe weather phenomena such as hail and thunderstorms because of historical data inhomogeneities and inadequacies in monitoring systems\u201d\n\u201cIn summary, the current assessment concludes that there is not enough evidence at present to suggest more than low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall) since the middle of the 20th century due to lack of direct observations, geographical inconsistencies in the trends, and dependencies of inferred trends on the index choice. Based on updated studies, AR4 conclusions regarding global increasing trends in drought since the 1970s were probably overstated. However, it is likely that the frequency and intensity of drought has increased in the Mediterranean and West Africa and decreased in central North America and north-west Australia since 1950\u201d\n\u201cIn summary, confidence in large scale changes in the intensity of extreme extratropical cyclones since 1900 is low\u201d\nShort version: Lord Lawson was right.\nNow the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which Lord Lawson chairs, has made a formal complaint about Ofcom\u2019s judgement.\nWithout providing any evidence to justify disputing the IPCC\u2019s conclusions, Ofcom claimed that Lawson\u2019s statement about extreme weather was incorrect and not sufficiently challenged by the BBC presenter during the interview. Ofcom, however, appear to base its ruling on information from unnamed complainants, the BBC (and possibly from other unnamed sources) without publishing that information or where it obtained it from. As a result, nobody is able to see it and judge its credibility. It did not ask Lord Lawson for any information regarding his statements. That Ofcom should judge on scientific matters without justifying their decision sets a worrying precedent concerning the oversight of journalists.\nIt will, of course, be completely ignored by Ofcom. But the issues it raises are very serious.\nOfcom rulings are not taken lightly by the UK broadcast industry. Broadcasters like the BBC are bound by its terms. What Ofcom is doing here is ensuring that BBC will be less likely than ever before to give space to skeptic voices.\nThis won\u2019t bother the BBC much: for years it has acted as one of the climate industry\u2019s most enthusiastic propagandists.\nNow the Ofcom ruling has given the BBC just the excuse it needs to be even more one-sided in its treatment of the global warming debate.\nWhere does this leave democracy in Britain? In a pretty poor shape, I would argue. If you are going to have government-appointed regulators deciding what broadcasters are allowed to say, the bare minimum the public has a right to expect of these censorship watchdogs is that they should be rigorous, transparent and accountable.\nOfcom has failed here on all those counts.\nIt also fails in another key area: impartiality.\nUntil last year, Ofcom was run by a fanatical Europhile called Bill Emmott.\nHere is Guido\u2018s report on what has just happened to him:\nAn ultra-Remainer former quango chief will receive a huge pay-off from the taxpayer despite being sacked for openly criticising the government on Brexit. Former Economist editor Bill Emmott became head of Ofcom\u2019s Content Board in 2015; as a journalist Emmott proposed extending the single market, advocated a new EU \u2018energy union\u2019 and made an anti-Brexit film for the BBC called The Great European Disaster Movie. He is a properly fanatical Europhile\u2026 The following year Emmott was let go having given an interview to an Italian newspaper headlined: \u201cOutside Europe the UK dies\u201d. He had also tweeted: \u201cPrediction: Jeremy Corbyn will be Britain\u2019s PM by 2020. Boris\u2019s legacy\u201d and \u201cGove scaremongers on migration free-for-all\u201d. Ofcom bosses are subject to strict impartiality guidelines, all the more crucial in a referendum year\u2026\nEmmott is entirely typical of the liberal elite troughers who get put in charge of running quangos like Ofcom. Their values are pro-EU, pro-Climate-Industrial-Complex, anti-free-market, anti-Conservative.\nHow can they possibly be trusted to reach fair and balanced judgements on matters as contentious and heavily politicized as climate change.\nThey can\u2019t, as Ofcom has just demonstrated.\nThis is a disgrace \u2013 and one which, more disgracefully still, you can be absolutely sure that Britain\u2019s useless Conservative government will not even attempt to remedy."}

This all fuels the growth of plants, which means more pollen, earlier pollen, and pollen that stays around longer,\u201d she added.\nDr. Tara Narula even went so far as to predict the concentration of pollen grains per cubic meter of air in the year 2040.

(AP)\nAfter two weeks, an international climate change conference in Bonn, Germany, attended by delegates from over 200 countries, has ended in failure, without no agreement on the major issues of finance and transparency.\nClimate change finance has been in trouble from the beginning. The 2015 climate change conference that produced the famous \u201cParis Climate Change Accord\u201d dictated that the \u201crich countries\u201d of the world would provide $100 billion per year to the \u201cdeveloping countries,\u201d starting in 2020. Even before the election of Donald Trump, it was highly unlikely that that requirement would be met.\nHowever, since Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris agreement, other \u201crich countries\u201d now have to find a way to fill the gap that was created.\nAs I have described many times in the past, the climate change has never actually accomplished anything \u2013 that is, you have leaders of one country after another taking a holier-than-thou attitude toward the United States about the Paris accord, but their carbon emissions go down little if at all. In the case of Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel has had the most holier-than-thou attitude of all, carbon emissions have not declined for nearly a decade, and have been increasing for the last three years.\nI first wrote about this subject in 2007 in \u201cUN Climate Change conference appears to be ending in farce.\u201d That conference was held at a Bali Beach Resort where 159 countries sent delegates to sip mai tais on the beach and attend an occasional meeting. The rich countries would have to contribute $100 billion to a fund for developing countries. The United Nations would control this money and administer the fund.\nAt that time, digging a little deeper, it turned out that Louis Redshaw, Head of Environment Markets, Barclays Capital, was leading an effort to issue synthetic securities to trade in carbon credits. It was predicted that the carbon-trading market would top $1 trillion within a decade. Readers might recall that 2007 was the year that the subprime mortgage financial crisis was starting.\nIn the last 11 years since that conference, nothing has changed. Climate change has accomplished nothing except as a financial scam. Climate Change News and Reuters and Washington Post and Heritage\nChina backs out of its climate change commitments with \u2018bifurcation\u2019\nThe climate change conference in Bonn that ended on Thursday was supposed to resolve many issues, including two major ones: finance and transparency.\nWhen Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, there were international cries that without the leadership of the United States, other countries must assume leadership. The European Union took on the role of becoming the leader of the \u201crich\u201d or developed countries, while China would be the leader of the developing countries.\nChina has the 2nd largest economy in the world, and Chinese people brag that centrally-planned economy is stronger than any other economy in the world. China is implementing its \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d in countries throughout Asia by lending them money to build infrastructure and sending Chinese workers to provide the labor. China is spending its enormous wealth by setting debt traps in all these countries with huge debts that they won\u2019t be able to repay.\nChina is also growing into the worst climate change violator in the world, building a new coal plant every week.\nAnd yet, when it comes to climate change, they claim to be a \u201cdeveloping country\u201d so they will not have to provide funding under the Paris accord.\nSo China is failing in climate change finance. What we are seeing at the climate change conference in Bonn this last week is that they\u2019re also failing in climate change transparency.\nChina is demanding that it not be held to any climate change standards whatsoever. In return for all the money they are getting from the rich countries starting in 2020, the developing countries are supposed to start reducing emissions in 2020.\nThe issues are transparency and bookkeeping. Each country is required to open its accounting books to prove that it is meeting its emission reduction commitments.\nBut China is now demanding \u201cbifurcation.\u201d This is a technical term meaning that the transparency and bookkeeping rules apply only to the rich countries, not to the developing countries.\nThis means that the \u201crich\u201d developed countries have to pay all the money and also meet the transparency and bookkeeping rules to prove that they\u2019re meeting their emission commitments.\nBut the developing countries just have to sit back and collect money, and claim that they are reducing emissions without having to provide any evidence.\nChina can go on building a new coal power plant every week, and just claim that it is magic coal that reduces emissions rather than increasing them.

{"headline": "new nasa chief bridenstine says humans contribute to climate change 'in a major way'", "body": "In a NASA town hall yesterday (May 17), NASA's new administrator, Jim Bridenstine, said that he knows Earth's climate is changing, and that humans contribute to it \"in a major way,\" also supporting NASA's research into that important area. The statement is significant because Bridenstine has expressed doubt about human-caused climate change in the past, causing some to question his suitability to lead a fact-focused NASA.\nIn 2013, as an Oklahoma congressman, Bridenstine claimed there was no current trend toward global warming. More recently, such as in his NASA administrator confirmation hearings last November, he has acknowledged that human activity contributes to climate change. But he had stopped short of saying that humans are the phenomenon's primary cause.\nAt the NASA employee town hall, Bridenstine described how his thinking had \"evolved\" on the topic and laid out his current beliefs.\n\"I don't deny the consensus that the climate is changing; in fact, I fully believe and know that the climate is changing,\" he said. \"I also know that we, human beings, are contributing to it in a major way. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. We're putting it into the atmosphere in volumes that we haven't seen, and that greenhouse gas is warming the planet.\nMore From Space.com Bridenstine claimed\n\"That is absolutely happening, and we are responsible for it,\" he added. \"NASA is the one agency on the face of the planet that has the most credibility to do the science necessary so that we can understand it better than ever before.\"\nBridenstine's support of climate change research is in contrast to what many might expect from the current presidential administration: For instance, five Earth science and climate missions were written out of the White House's proposed 2018 NASA budget, and last year President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the worldwide Paris Agreement to limit climate change.\nResponding to a specific question on one of those cut climate missions, the Orbital Carbon Observatory Mission 3, Bridenstine said that, in his understanding, the mission is still set to launch in January 2019 after being funded by Congress.\nBridenstine reassured NASA employees that the agency will follow the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) guidelines that studying climate change is a top priority \u2014 particularly, reducing \"climate uncertainty\" by studying how interactions between the water cycle and energy cycle affect the changing climate, as well as looking at the impact of climate change on ecosystems.\n\"We need to make sure that NASA is continuing to do the science, and we need to make sure that the science is void and free from partisan or political kind of rhetoric,\" he said. \"We have guidance from an apolitical, nonpartisan National Academy of Science telling us what is important for humanity, and we're going to follow it.\"\nBridenstine noted that NASA also says to prioritize weather and air-quality forecasting. His 2013 claim was that too much research is done into climate change instead of weather forecasting. Now, if his words to NASA employees are any guide, Bridenstine seems committed to supporting both.\nOriginal article on Space.com."}

There was the most tremendous rumpus when he made his announcement, but the End-Of-The-World-Is-Nigh-Unless feeling that made headlines before Rio, Kyoto, Copenhagen, Paris, and numerous other gatherings, has gone. This feeling was essential to achieve the \u201cEverybody\u2019s doing it, so we must do it\u201d effect the organisers sought. The media barely noticed the recent Bonn meeting. I doubt if they will get apocalyptic about the next big show, \u201cCOP24\u201d in Katowice, Poland, this December. The Poles are among the nations emerging as \u201cclimate realists\u201d \u2013 people with their own coal and a very strong wish not to depend on the Russians. Climate-change zealotry is looking like CND after the installation of cruise and Pershing missiles in the 1980s \u2013 a bit beside the point.\nMoore is absolutely right about the symbolic significance of Trump\u2019s decision. Of course it was of great practical service to the U.S. economy \u2013 freeing it from the shackles of European-Union-driven carbon reduction targets which would have hamstrung U.S. business and driven up costs for consumers. But its worldwide impact will be greater still.\nTrump has performed the same service as the little boy who pointed out that the Emperor was wearing no clothes. Man-made global warming is the biggest lie of our age and the only reason it survived so long is that all the world\u2019s nations politely agreed to pretend, for various reasons ranging from self-interest to moral posturing, that it was true.\nWith the U.S. no longer playing that game it\u2019s much, much harder for everyone else to go on pretending there\u2019s a consensus.\nBut not, unfortunately, impossible.\nAs Moore goes on to suggest, the apparatus of the climate \u2018consensus\u2019 is so vast and all-encompassing that it will take years, if not decades, to dismantle:\nThe great guardians of this attempt at government by global conferencing will continue to make their speeches and write their reports, usually paid for out of public funds. The frameworks and panels, the COPs and ARs, the climate-change organisations that fill 168 pages of Wikipedia, all these will continue, though with diminished status. Priesthoods usually find ways to survive longer than the belief systems they represent.\nAgain, Moore is bang-on about the religious nature of the climate change scare. Like all religions, climate change is a matter of faith not of science.

{"headline": "climate change killed the aliens, and it will probably kill us too, new simulation suggests", "body": "Did climate change already kill all the aliens we've been searching for?\nAccording to astrophysicist Adam Frank, it's certainly a possibility \u2014 and whether humans are doomed to the same fate may already be out of our hands.\nFrank, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Rochester in New York, is the lead author of a new paper published May 1 in the journal Astrobiology that aims to take what Frank calls a \"10,000-light-year\" view of anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change. Using mathematical models based on the disappearance of a real-life lost civilization here on Earth (the former inhabitants of Easter Island), Frank and his colleagues simulated how various alien civilizations might rise and fall if they were to increasingly convert their planet's limited natural resources into energy. [12 Possible Reasons We Haven't Found Aliens]\n\"The laws of physics demand that any young population, building an energy-intensive civilization like ours, is going to have feedback on its planet,\" Frank said in a statement. \"Seeing climate change in this cosmic context may give us better insight into what's happening to us now and how to deal with it.\"\nThe results, as you might expect, were generally pretty grim. Of four common \"trajectories\" for energy-intense civilizations, three ended in apocalypse. The fourth scenario \u2014 a path that involved converting the whole alien society to sustainable sources of energy \u2014 worked only when civilizations recognized the damage they were doing to the planet, and acted in the right away.\n\"The last scenario is the most frightening,\" Frank said. \"Even if you did the right thing, if you waited too long, you could still have your population collapse.\"\nThree paths to apocalypse\nFor Frank, the path to modeling an apocalypse starts with Easter Island.\n\"Easter Island presents a particularly useful example for our own purposes since it is often taken as a lesson for global sustainability,\" Frank and his colleagues wrote in the paper. \"Many studies indicate that Easter Island's inhabitants depleted their resources, leading to starvation and termination of the island's civilization.\"\nWorking from previous equations that modeled the fall of Easter Island's population alongside the depletion of its resources, the team found four possible end points for a hypothetical alien civilization similarly constrained by limited natural resources.\n\"The first trajectory we found is what we call the die-off,\" Frank said.\nIn this scenario, the civilization's population skyrockets over a short period of time, and as the aliens guzzle energy and belch out greenhouse gases, the planet's temperature spikes, too. (In this study, temperature was used to represent human-made impacts on the planet's habitability via greenhouse gas pollution.) The population peaks, then suddenly plummets as rising temperatures make survival harder and harder. The population eventually levels off, but with a fraction of the people who were around before. [Doomsday: 9 Real Ways the World Could End]\n\"Imagine if seven out of 10 people you knew died quickly,\" Frank said. \"It's not clear a complex technological civilization could survive that kind of change.\"\nThe second scenario is sustainability. Here, both the planet's population and its global temperature climb rapidly but then level off when the civilization recognizes how its resource management is affecting nature. To reach an equilibrium, Frank said, the population would need to switch from resources that take a high toll on the planet (like oil) to more sustainable resources (like solar energy). Civilization is saved!\nBoth the third and fourth scenarios are called \"collapse.\" Here, as in the \"die-off\" scenario, both the planet's population and the planet's temperature rise dramatically over a short period. But this time, when people start dying from a lack of basic resources, there are no survivors. Whether a civilization merely dies off or totally collapses depends on how sensitive the environment is and how quickly it responds to rising populations.\nEven if the civilization realizes it's damaging the environment and makes attempts to switch to sustainable resources \u2014 a scenario called \"collapse with resource change\" \u2014 it's too late. The civilization might see a temporary slowing in the population decline, but eventually, it drops to zero anyway. The damage is done; civilization is doomed.\nAct now while civilization lasts\nThe difference between a sustainable future and a deadly collapse was largely dependent on a population's foresight \u2014 how soon they realized they were destroying their planet, and how quickly they took action. According to Frank, this difference should motivate humans to take climate change seriously.\n\"Across cosmic space and time, you're going to have winners \u2014 who managed to see what was going on and figure out a path through it \u2014 and losers, who just couldn't get their act together and their civilization fell by the wayside,\" Frank said.\n\"The question is, which category do we want to be in?\"\nOriginally published on Live Science."}

{"headline": "not just heat: climate change signs can be seen all around", "body": "You don't just feel the heat of global warming, you can see it in action all around.\nSome examples of where climate change's effects have been measured:\n\u2014Glaciers across the globe are melting and retreating, with 279 billion tons of ice lost since 2002, according to NASA's GRACE satellite. Jakobshavn Glacier in Greenland is flowing faster than any other glacier on Earth. In 2012, it hit a record pace of about 75 inches per hour (1.9 meters). In 2017, it slowed down to 40 inches per hour (1 meter). The Portage Glacier in Alaska has retreated so much it cannot be seen from the visitor center that opened in 1986.\n\u2014In the Rocky Mountains, the first robins of spring are arriving 10.5 days earlier than 30 years ago. The first larkspur wildflower is showing up eight days earlier and the marmots are coming out of hibernation five days earlier, according to data gathered by the Rocky Mountain Biological Lab.\n\u2014On average, during the past 30 years there have been more major hurricanes (those with winds of more than 110 mph), they have lasted longer and they produced more energy than the previous 30 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of storm data. Other studies have shown that the first named storm in the Atlantic forms nearly a month earlier than 30 years ago and storms are moving slower, allowing more rain to fall.\n\u2014Across the globe, seas have risen about 3 inches since 1993. That doesn't sound like much, but it is enough to cover the entire United States in water about 9 feet deep. Places like Miami Beach, Florida, and Norfolk, Virginia, flood frequently with high tides.\n\u2014The number of acres burned in the U.S. by wildfire has doubled compared with 30 years ago. Last year, more than 10 million acres burned. Over the last five years, an average of 6.7 million acres burned a year. From 1984 to 1988, about 2.8 million years burned, on average.\n\u2014Allergies have gotten worse with longer growing seasons and more potent pollen. High ragweed pollen days have increased by between 15 and 29 days since 1990 in a swath of the country from Oklahoma City north to Winnipeg, Canada, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture study.\n\u2014In the western United States the cute rodent called a pika needs weather around freezing for most of the year. But those habitats are shrinking, forcing them to higher altitudes. University of Colorado's Chris Ray, a pika expert, said she hasn't definitively linked climate change to dramatic reductions in pika populations, but she found that they have disappeared more from places that are warming and drying.\n\u2014Extreme one-day rainfall across the nation has increased 80 percent over the past 30 years. Ellicott City, Maryland, had so-called thousand-year floods in 2016 and this year. Flooding in Louisiana, West Virginia and Houston in 2016, South Carolina, Texas and Oklahoma in 2015, Michigan and parts of the Northeast in 2014 all caused more than $1 billion in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\u2014The number of polar bears in parts of Alaska dropped 40 percent since the late 1990s. When scientists have weighed polar bears recently in certain locations they were losing 2.9 to 5.5 pounds per day at a time of year when they were supposed to be putting on weight.\n\u2014Warmer water is repeatedly causing mass global bleaching events to Earth's fragile coral reefs. Before 1998 there had been no global mass bleaching events \u2014 which turn the living coral white and often lead to death. But there have been three in the last two decades. U.S. government coral reef specialist Mark Eakin said for multiple reasons, including global warming, \"most of the reefs that were in great shape in the 1980s in Florida are just barely hanging on now.\"\n___\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

{"headline": "climate change 'deniers' are old, white, racist", "body": "Climate change deniers are more likely to be old, white and racist, a study claims.\nThe relationship between racial attitudes and public opinion about climate change is examined. Public opinion data from Pew and American National Election Studies surveys are used to show that racial identification and prejudices are increasingly correlated with opinions about climate change during the Obama presidency. Results show that racial identification became a significant predictor of climate change concern following Obama\u2019s election in 2008, and that high levels of racial resentment are strongly correlated with reduced agreement with the scientific consensus on climate change. These results offer evidence for an effect termed the spillover of racialization. This helps further explain why the public remains so polarized on climate change, given the extent to which racial grievances and identities have become entangled with elite communication about climate change and its related policies today.\nIndeed, the study \u2013 by Salil D Benegal of the Department of Political Science at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana \u2013 argues that some skeptics were driven towards their position of climate denialism because of President Obama\u2019s skin color.\nAs the Sierra Club reports:\n[\u2026] The paper hypothesizes that, however moderate his actions, the mere existence of our first African American president dropping climate change into the State of the Union Address and joining the Paris climate accord correlates with a significant number of white Americans deciding that they were done believing in climate change. This correlation has also been documented with regard to health-care reform\u2014after the Obama administration made it a priority, a subset of white Americans who had supported the issue during the Clinton administration suddenly switched their position. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make a claim in the study that race is the single most important or necessarily a massive component of all environmental attitudes\u201d says Salil Benegal, the study\u2019s author, who teaches political science at DePauw University. \u201cBut it\u2019s a significant thing that we should be looking out for.\u201d\nIn the late 90s, the gap between Democrats and Republicans in their views on climate change was much narrower. But in the Obama era it widened drastically, which the paper ascribes to racism.\nWhen Benegal looked at the Pew data, he found that the percentage of white Americans who said that they believed climate change is a very serious problem declined during the Obama administration. When he looked at the ANES data, he found that white Republicans who scored at the highest level for racial resentment were over three times as likely to disagree with the statement that climate change was real than white Republicans who tested at the lowest level of the scale. A low-resentment white Republican had a 57 percent chance of disagreeing with the statement that climate change is caused by humans, while their high-resentment equivalent was 84 percent likely to do the same thing. Before Benegal was a political scientist, he was a chemistry major. But after he graduated, he realized that he was more interested in how scientific findings were communicated and particularly why public mistrust of scientists was so high in the United States relative to other parts of the world. Climate change seemed like a perfect way to examine this strange phenomenon. In another paper Benegal published with his former dissertation advisor, Lyle Scruggs, both found that Gallup data showed that the belief in climate change as real and caused by humans has dropped among Republican voters just in the last year.\nAnother possibility, apparently not considered by the paper\u2019s author, is that the evidence against \u201cman-made global warming\u201d theory is growing stronger and that Republicans, being more skeptical of the mainstream media, and being better-informed generally, have been quicker to grasp the truth than Democrats.\nAs Benegal was presumably taught when he studied for his hard science major, correlation is not causation."}

{"headline": "vatican cardinal slams shipping industry for worsening climate change", "body": "Vatican Cardinal Peter Turkson criticized the shipping industry Sunday, claiming that \u201cvessels produce carbon dioxide emissions that significantly contribute to global climate change and acidification.\u201d\nIn his message for the yearly celebration of \u201cSea Sunday,\u201d Turkson, head of the Vatican\u2019s Department for Integral Human Development, first seemed to praise the work of seafarers before blaming them for their role in aggravating \u201cglobal warming.\u201d\nTurkson recalled the sacrifice of seafarers who often live for months at a time in a confined space, \u201caway from their families and loved ones missing the most important and meaningful events in their families (birthdays\u2019, graduations, etc.) and failing to be present during times of trials and difficulties such as sickness and death.\u201d\nHe went on to express his gratitude for all those who make their living on the seas, noting that seafarers \u201cplay a significant role in our global economy by transporting from one corner of the world to another 90% of all the goods we use in our daily life.\u201d\nThe Ghanaian cardinal\u2019s tone shifted from praise to reproach, however, when speaking of seafarers\u2019 role in \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\u201cLike all types of transportation that use fossil fuels, vessels produce carbon dioxide emissions that significantly contribute to global climate change and acidification,\u201d the cardinal declared. \u201cBesides carbon dioxide ships also release a handful of other pollutants that contribute to the problem.\u201d\nIn speaking of \u201cother pollutants\u201d besides carbon dioxide, Turkson fell into the common error of our time of imagining carbon dioxide to be a \u201cpollutant.\u201d\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless, non-toxic gas essential to the welfare of the earth\u2019s biosphere. By definition, a pollutant is a foreign substance or condition that contaminates air, water, or soil, whereas carbon dioxide is an essential component of the air we breathe, necessary for the health and survival of plant life.\nCalling CO2 an air pollutant is like calling oxygen a \u201cwater pollutant.\u201d\nWhile there has never been a single documented case of a person being killed by carbon dioxide related \u201cglobal warming,\u201d real pollution of air, water and land is killing an average of 25,000 people every day across the globe.\nIn 2017 study, the prestigious, UK-based Lancet journal revealed that pollution, not CO2, is the \u201clargest environmental cause of disease and death.\u201d\nPollution-related diseases were responsible for an estimated 9 million premature deaths in 2015, or some 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence combined, the Lancet found.\nPollution is not only the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world today, the Lancet study found, but diseases caused by pollution were responsible for roughly 16 percent of all deaths worldwide\u2014\u201cthree times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined and 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence.\u201d\nAir pollution is measured by the presence of harmful foreign substances in the air that can cause disease and even death in human beings and other aerobic organisms.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), for instance, measures air pollution by the mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less than 2.5 microns in diameter. These are the particles that cause diseases of all sorts and are responsible for most deaths by air pollution.\nAccording to the WHO, exposure to particulate matter increases the risk of acute lower respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.\nIn its most recent report, the WHO analyzed the \u201cannual median concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 \u03bcm or less (PM2.5) for both urban population and rural and urban population\u201d and found that the United States was one of the most pollution-free nations in the world.\nThe annual mean concentrations of particulate matter in the air range from less than 10 to over 100 \u00b5g/m3, the report states. At the very low end of the spectrum, the United States has a concentration of just 8, while China has a concentration more than seven times higher at 59, India at 66, Egypt at 101 and Saudi Arabia with the worst air pollution at 127.\nNowhere in the report was carbon dioxide mentioned, for the simple reason that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant.\nFollow Thomas D.

{"headline": "science says record heat, fires worsened by climate change", "body": "Heat waves are setting all-time temperature records across the globe, again. Europe suffered its deadliest fire in more than a century, and one of nearly 90 large fires in the U.S. West burned dozens of homes and forced the evacuation of at least 37,000 people near Redding, California. Flood-inducing downpours have pounded the U.S. East this week.\nIt's all part of summer \u2014 but it's all being made worse by human-caused climate change, scientists say.\n\"Weirdness abounds,\" said Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis.\nJapan hit 106 degrees on Monday, its hottest temperature ever. Records fell in parts of Massachusetts, Maine, Wyoming, Colorado, Oregon, New Mexico and Texas. And then there's crazy heat in Europe, where normally chill Norway, Sweden and Finland all saw temperatures they have never seen before on any date, pushing past 90 degrees. So far this month, at least 118 of these all-time heat records have been set or tied across the globe, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThe explanations should sound as familiar as the crash of broken records.\n\"We now have very strong evidence that global warming has already put a thumb on the scales, upping the odds of extremes like severe heat and heavy rainfall,\" Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh said. \"We find that global warming has increased the odds of record-setting hot events over more than 80 percent of the planet, and has increased the odds of record-setting wet events at around half of the planet.\"\nClimate change is making the world warmer because of the build-up of heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil and other human activities. And experts say the jet stream \u2014 which dictates weather in the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 is again behaving strangely.\n\"An unusually sharply kinked jet stream has been stuck in place for weeks now,\" said Jeff Masters, director of the private Weather Underground. He says that allows the heat to stay in place over three areas where the kinks are: Europe, Japan and the western United States.\nThe same jet stream pattern caused the 2003 European heat wave, the 2010 Russian heat wave and fires, the 2011 Texas and Oklahoma drought and the 2016 Canadian wildfires, Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said, pointing to past studies by him and others. He said in an email that these extremes are \"becoming more common because of human-caused climate change and in particular, the amplified warming in the Arctic.\"\nClimate scientists have long said they can't directly link single weather events, like a heat wave, to human caused climate change without extensive study. In the past decade they have used observations, statistics and computer simulations to calculate if global warming increases the chances of the events.\nA study by European scientists Friday found that the ongoing European heat wave is twice as likely because of human-caused global warming, though those conclusions have not yet been confirmed by outside scientists. The World Weather Attribution team said they compared three-day heat measurements and forecasts for the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland with historical records going back to the early 1900s.\n\"The world is becoming warmer and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,\" said Friederike Otto, a member of the team and deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford.\nErich Fischer, an expert on weather extremes at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich who wasn't part of the analysis said the authors used well-established methods to make their conclusions.\nGeorgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb said the link between climate change and fires isn't as strong as it is with heat waves, but it is becoming clearer.\nA devastating fire in Greece \u2014 with at least 83 fatalities \u2014 is the deadliest fire in Europe since 1900, according to the International Disaster Database run by the Centre for the Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels, Belgium.\nIn the United States on Friday there were 89 active large fires, consuming nearly 900,000 acres, according the National Interagency Fire Center. So far this year, fires have burned 4.15 million acres, which is nearly 14 percent higher than average over the past 10 years.\nThe first major science study to connect greenhouse gases to stronger and longer heat waves was in 2004. It was titled \"More intense, more frequent and longer lasting heat waves in the 21st century.\" Study author Gerald Meehl of the National Center for Atmospheric Research said Friday that now it \"reads like a prediction of what has been happening and will continue to happen as long as average temperatures continue to rise with ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels.

But they also blame municipalities that are expanding housing into previously undeveloped areas.\n\"There are just places were there should not be subdivisions,\" said Kurt Henke, a former fire chief in Sacramento who now serves as a consultant to fire organizations. \"We're not talking about a single family who wants to build a house in the woods. I'm talking about subdivisions encroaching into the wild land urban interface that put them in the path of these destructive fires.\"\nHenke wants more funding from the state legislature to deploy firefighters to areas where conditions are ripe for fast-moving fires, so they can be respond quickly if a blaze breaks out.\nThe fire that affected Redding \u2014 a city of about 92,000 people about 250 miles (400 kilometers) north of San Francisco \u2014 started Monday about 10 miles (16 kilometers) west of the city before sweeping Thursday through the historic Gold Rush town of Shasta and nearby Keswick. It then jumped the Sacramento River and took out subdivisions on the western edge of Redding.\nRedding sits at the northern end of the agricultural Central Valley, surrounded by a scenic landscape. It has a downtown with a theater and wine bar and homes spread out in subdivisions.\nTwo firefighters were killed \u2014 one from the Redding Fire Department and the other a bulldozer operator hired for the fire. Hundreds of homes were destroyed and nearly 40,000 people were under evacuation orders.\nLike the fires in Santa Rosa and Ventura last year, wind was a major contributor to the blaze's spread.\n\"It's ripping trees off the ground and throwing them across the street into homes,\" Chad Carroll, a spokesman for CalFire said Friday. \"That's pretty strange and unusual.\"\nCalfire Director Ken Pimlott described the fire activity at a news conference on Friday as almost like a \"tornado.\"\n\"What we're seeing not just here in Shasta County but literally statewide, fires that are growing exponentially,\" he said.\nWhile touring Ventura County neighborhoods ravaged by fire last year, Gov. Jerry Brown said drought and climate change mean California faces a \"new reality\" where lives and property are continually threatened by fire.\nThe state is experiencing longer periods of warm temperatures and dry conditions that are making major fires nearly a year-round possibility, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\"What we're seeing with some of the most dangerous fires is that they're spreading quickly, burning very hot or producing their own weather,\" he said.\nStill, he agreed with other experts that say the destruction was also the result of more people living closer to fire-prone areas.\n\"Over the years, we're putting more people in harm's way,\" he said. \"More people living in high fire risk areas than usual.\"\nThe fire in Santa Rosa in October 2017 destroyed nearly 2,700 homes, including in one neighborhood with expensive new subdivisions on a hillside at the edge of the city. The blaze in Ventura two months later destroyed more than 500 buildings.\nJacque Chase, an urban planning expert at California State University, Chico, said U.S. government statistics show more homes are going up across the country in areas that sit on the boundary of urban areas and undeveloped land. That increases the risk of fires caused by human activity. It also means firefighters have to change their approach.\n\"They have to deal with actually saving lives and saving property,\" she said.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Sudhin Thanawala reported from San Francisco."}

Our environment becomes, in effect, a steam room; sweating, our great adaptive tool, is no longer effective,\u201d Vanderbilt warns.\nThus, if global warming predictions hold true, he says, the body\u2019s capability for self-cooling in extreme heat may prove insufficient for new environmental scenarios.\nThe author says that certain studies have indicated that the \u201ccritical thermal maximum\u201d for human beings is 35 degrees Celsius (95\u00ba F), or around skin temperature. Beyond this temperature, \u201cany exposure for more than six hours would probably be intolerable even for the fittest of humans, resulting in hyperthermia,\u201d or heatstroke, Vanderbilt says, citing a 2015 article by Jeremy Pal and Elfatih Eltahir in Nature Climate Change.\nAccording to Pal and Eltahir, thanks to climate change \u201cthe deadly 35-degree threshold will increasingly be reached by the end of the century, in regions like the Persian Gulf and the densely inhabited regions around the Indus and Ganges river basins.\u201d\nAnd \u201cas temperatures continue to climb and indoor air-conditioning systems are strained, some adaptive responses will begin to kick in,\u201d Vanderbilt predicts, which could include an alteration in human organs, an evolution of human sweat \u201cbetter suited for aridity,\u201d a permanent shift in metabolism, or even becoming taller and longer limbed \u201cso as to dissipate heat more reliably.\u201d\nThen again, one supposes that if current climate models turned out to be correct, while certain parts of the earth slowly entered a danger zone of higher temperatures, other parts of the planet would logically mutate from uninhabitable frozen wasteland into territory friendlier to human dwelling and agriculture.\nThen again, average global temperatures in 2018 are on track to be slightly cooler than 2017, and 2017 was cooler than 2016.\nWhen dealing with climate forecasts for 50 or 100 years in the future, the numbers are only as reliable as the models that generate them.\nFollow Thomas D.

By 1992 he was clearly understood to be a moderate justice rather than a conservative, and lawyers would craft arguments to target his vote throughout most of his tenure. With very few exceptions, he became the quintessential swing vote once Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor left the Court in 2006, occupying that role alone for the next 12 years. He retired on July 31, 2018, at the age of 81, after precisely three decades on the nation\u2019s highest court.\nThe Court\u2019s only significant action during his final month came this week, when the Court on Monday allowed a climate-change lawsuit to proceed.\nTwenty-one children \u2013 represented by an organization with the consent of their parents \u2013 filed a federal lawsuit in Oregon, claiming a constitutional right to a sustainable environment, and suing the federal government \u2013 including President Trump directly \u2013 for violating that right by allowing regulations and policies that the plaintiffs claim leads to man-made global warming.\nA left-wing federal trial judge in Oregon refused to dismiss the lawsuit, and also refused to certify his order as immediately appealable. The U.S. Department of Justice then filed a writ of mandamus \u2013 an extremely rare legal move \u2013 to the Ninth Circuit (Kennedy\u2019s former court), asking for the court to order the district judge to dismiss the case.\nThe Ninth Circuit refused, but noted in its decision that it fully expected the federal district court to narrow the scope of the case quickly, and not allow any outlandish discovery orders or legal demands. But when the district court instead signaled that it could allow sweeping orders for testimony and documents, Solicitor General Noel Francisco applied for a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court, or alternatively for the Supreme Court to issue the writ of mandamus.\nThe Supreme Court denied both forms of relief, but signaled to the lower courts that they had better rein in this case quickly:\nThe Government\u2019s request for relief is premature and is denied without prejudice. The breadth of respondents\u2019 claims is striking, however, and the justiciability of those claims presents substantial grounds for difference of opinion. The District Court should take these concerns into account in assessing the burdens of discovery and trial, as well as the desirability of a prompt ruling on the Government\u2019s pending dispositive motions.\n\u201cI am grateful that the justices put a shot across the bow of this out-of-control federal judge in Oregon not to let this crazy lawsuit turn into an all-out circus,\u201d said former Trump Presidential Transition Team domestic policy adviser Ken Blackwell in an exclusive reaction to Breitbart News. \u201cWhile we all want a clean and sustainable environment, nothing in the Constitution confers an individual right to launch a court challenge in what is essentially a political and policy debate attacking all the energy we get from fossil fuels.\u201d\nBy calling the Justice Department\u2019s filing \u201cpremature,\u201d the Supreme Court reminded the parties that it can always step in later in the litigation if the trial judge permits things to continue on their present course.\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

{"headline": "earth's soil is hyperventilating thanks to climate change", "body": "You know it's hot out there when even the soil is hyperventilating.\nAccording to a new study published yesterday (Aug. 1) in the journal Nature, there's about twice as much carbon dioxide (CO2) stored in Earth's soil as there is floating around the atmosphere, and for the last few decades, that underground greenhouse gas has been leaking out at a significantly increased rate.\nBased on more than 2,000 sources of climate data taken from ecosystems around the world, a team of soil scientists found that the rate of CO2 released from Earth's soil has increased globally by about 1.2 percent in just 25 years \u2014 and you can blame that on hot, hungry microbes.\n\"We're talking about a huge quantity of carbon,\" study co-author Vanessa Bailey, a soil scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington state, said in a statement. \"Microbes exert an outsize influence on the world that is very hard to measure on such a large scale.\"\nThe breathing Earth\nDirt doesn't actually breathe, of course, but it sort of looks that way when tiny, underground organisms help release the CO2 stored in plant roots, dead leaves and other natural detritus. Hungry microbes gorge on the tasty carbon stored in this plant matter, and then release carbon dioxide as a natural byproduct of this feeding, just as you do when you exhaleafter a deep breath.\nThis process is known as \"soil respiration,\" and it's an important complement to photosynthesis \u2014 the process by which plants turn CO2, water and light into energy \u2014 helping to keep ecosystems around the world running smoothly.\nBut lately, researchers have found that as global temperatures rise, microbes in the soil have been releasing CO2 faster than plants can snatch it up again. Previous studies have indicated that tree roots and certain microbes both respire more frequently at higher temperatures (up until a certain point, when the intense heat causes the organisms to stop functioning completely). But the exact effects of that increase in respiration had never been studied on a global scale until now.\nTo better understand the potential links between rising global temperatures and soil respiration, a team of researchers led by Ben Bond-Lamberty at the Joint Global Change Research Institute at the University of Maryland, College Park, examined data from two huge global nature surveys: the Global Soil Respiration Database and FLUXNET, which collectively draw soil, temperature, rainfall and other data from a network of more than 2,000 sources across several ecosystems.\nThe data showed that the rate of global soil respiration had increased by about 1.2 percent in the 25-year window between 1990 and 2014. Most of that growth was due to increased microbial action; the tiny creatures in Earth's soil are freeing more and more greenhouse gases from our planet's surface.\nThe panting Earth\nWhile a 1.2 percent increase might not seem significant on its face, the researchers made it clear that even a modest change like this represents a \"massive\" ecosystem shift over a relatively short time. And while the full effects of this microbial huffing and puffing are hard to estimate, it's possible that all that extra CO2 will feed a self-intensifying loop of atmospheric warming and soil respiration over the years to come.\n\"Depending on how other components of the carbon cycle might respond due to climate warming, these soil changes can potentially contribute to even higher temperatures due to a feedback loop,\" Bond-Lamberty said in the statement. \"Soils around the globe are responding to a warming climate, which in turn can convert more carbon into carbon dioxide which enters the atmosphere.\"\nThe study has several limitations, the authors noted.

{"headline": "youtube adds 'fact checks' to videos that question 'climate change'", "body": "And so it begins: YouTube is now adding \u201cfact checks\u201d to videos which question the man-made global warming scare narrative.\nAccording to Buzzfeed News:\nYouTube is now adding fact checks to videos that question climate change, BuzzFeed News has confirmed, as a part of its ongoing effort to combat the rampant misinformation and conspiratorial fodder on its platform.\nOn July 9, the company added a blurb of text underneath some videos about climate change, which provided a scientifically accurate explainer. The text comes from the Wikipedia entry for global warming and states that \u201cmultiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming.\u201d This new feature follows YouTube\u2019s announcement in March that it would place descriptions from Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britannica next to videos on topics that spur conspiracy theories, such as the moon landing and the Oklahoma City bombing. In doing the same for climate videos, the company seems to be wading into more fraught and complex intellectual territory.\nSure, in many ways it\u2019s a trivial and pathetic gesture. Quoting Wikipedia as your credible source is a bit like citing CNN as the go-to site for all the latest info on Donald Trump. And anyway, that \u201cscientifically accurate explainer\u201d is at best vague, at worst far more misleading than the videos it is supposed to be \u201cfact checking.\u201d\nIt says:\n\u201cGlobal warming, also referred to as climate change is the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth\u2019s climate system and its related effects. Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming.\u201d\nSo the records show that there has been some gentle warming of less than 1 degree C since the world began emerging from the Little Ice Age a century and a half ago. So what? This whole line of argument is a Straw Man, which wilfully misrepresents the sceptical position. It\u2019s not whether or not climate changes that preoccupies sceptics. It\u2019s whether recent warming is significantly man-made \u2013 and if it is, whether, it\u2019s something we should worry about, and whether it\u2019s within our means or in our interest to do anything about it anyway.\nBut the real issue here, of course, is that like Big Tech\u2019s near-blanket banning of Alex Jones, it\u2019s the thin end of the wedge.\nWe know that, given half the chance, Big Tech would like to go much, much further in its censorship of viewpoints which run counter to the prevailing Silicon Valley \u2018progressive\u2019 narrative.\nWe also know that it is being pushed in that direction by leftist politicians and activists and media outlets.\nThe George-Soros-funded Media Matters for America, for example, recently published a long screed excoriating Mark Zuckerberg for hosting climate sceptical articles, videos and adverts on Facebook.\nFacebook, well-known as a breeding ground for misinformation, has a particular problem with disseminating false and misleading messages about climate change science. The platform spreads climate-denying videos and other posts, hosts climate-denying ads, and officially partners with climate-denying media outlets and organizations.\nSo far, Zuckerberg has held firm. But for how much longer?\nWhat cannot be stated often enough about \u201cclimate change\u201d is that it is much more of a political issue than it is a scientific one.\nThere is no credible evidence that recent warming is unusual, worrying or unprecedented. Nor is there any credible evidence that it is significantly man-made. Nor yet is it obvious that we have the power to control the climate \u2013 or that it would be advisable to try to do so.\nSo, because the actual science has been so unhelpful to their cause, the people pushing the alarmist narrative have been forced to promote it by other means. To a large degree, these \u201cother means\u201d have entailed shutting down the opposition.\nAfter all, if you can\u2019t win an argument on facts, you only hope of victory is to ensure the other side never gets heard.\nAnd what better way to silence your opponents by declaring their articles and videos \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 and hiding the truth in the guise of public interest?"}

Thanks to a group of researchers looking at stalagmites in Romania, we may have proof this was indeed the case.\n\u201cFor many years we have wondered what could have caused their demise,\" said Dr. Vasile Erse, a co-author of the study and a senior lecturer at Northumbria University, in a statement. \"Were they pushed \u2018over the edge\u2019 by the arrival of modern humans, or were other factors involved?

But during the time of the last Ice Age and the arrival of modern humans in Europe, they became extinct.\nDuring cold periods of time, the team found a \"near complete absence\" of archaeological artifacts from the group, suggesting cooler temperatures meant fewer tools.\nThough Neanderthals had learned to control and manipulate fire, just like modern humans, Neanderthals did not incorporate fish and plants into their diet, giving them fewer food sources.\nAs temperatures became colder and these animals naturally became more scarce during the freezing temperatures, Neanderthals became more susceptible to climate change.\nGRUESOME HUMAN SACRIFICE DISCOVERY: SKULLS REVEAL GRISLY SECRETS OF LOST AZTEC CITY\n\u201cBefore now, we did not have climate records from the region where Neanderthals lived which had the necessary age accuracy and resolution to establish a link between when Neanderthals died out and the timing of these extreme cold periods,\u201d Dr. Ersek added. \u201cBut our findings indicate that the Neanderthal populations successively decreased during the repeated cold stadials.\"\nA stadial is a period of colder climate; conversely, an interstadial is a period of warmer climate.\nWhen temperatures started to warm up again, Neanderthals were left with a doomed fate, according to Dr. Ersek. \"[Their smaller populations could not expand as their habitat was also being occupied by modern humans and this facilitated a staggered expansion of modern humans into Europe.\u201d\nFollow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia"}

In September, Ocasio-Cortez was caught flat-footed during an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, in which she repeatedly struggled to articulate how she would pay for her $30 trillion 'Medicare for all' proposal, which critics called another example of her pie-in-the-sky rhetoric that would prove unworkable in reality.\nShe has also taken heat for banning the press from campaign events.

{"headline": "ap explains: driven by climate change, fire reshapes us west", "body": "Wildfires in the U.S. have charred more than 10,000 square miles so far this year, an area larger than the state of Maryland, with large fires still burning in every Western state including many that are not fully contained.\nWhether sparked by lightning or humans, fire has long been a force shaping the landscape of the U.S. West.\nHot, dry winds can whip flames into firestorms that leave behind charred wastelands prone to erosion and mudslides. Other fires clear out underbrush, open the forest floor to sunlight and stimulate growth.\nGovernment agencies in recent decades effectively upended that cycle of destruction and rebirth. Fire suppression policies allowed fuels to build up in many Western forests, making them more susceptible to major fires.\nThose influences are magnified as development creeps ever deeper into forests and climate change brings hotter temperatures. Recent images of subdivisions ablaze thrust the power and ecological role of wildfires into the spotlight.\nA look at the environmental effects of wildfires:\nSMOKE AND RUIN\nMost immediately fire brings destruction.\nTemperatures from extreme fires can top 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hot enough to kill all plant life, incinerate seeds hidden beneath the surface and bake the soil until it becomes impervious to rain.\nThe lifeless landscape becomes prone to severe erosion, fouling streams and rivers with silt that kills fish and other aquatic life. Torrents of muddy debris following fires last year in Southern California killed 21 people and destroyed 129 homes.\nU.S. Geological Survey scientists say the problem is getting worse as the area burned annually by wildfires increases. A study last year concluded sediment from erosion following fires would more than double by 2050 for about a third of western watersheds.\nSmoke from this summer's Western wildfires \u2014 a potential health hazard for at-risk individuals \u2014 prompted the closure of Yosemite National Park for more than two weeks and drifted to the East Coast , according to NASA. Recent research says it also impacts climate change as small particles spiral into the upper atmosphere and interfere with the sun's rays.\nCLIMATE QUESTIONS\nScientists broadly agree wildfires are getting bigger in North America and other parts of the world as the climate warms. But still emerging is how that change will alter the natural progression of fire and regrowth.\nThe time interval between wildfires in some locations is getting shorter, even as there's less moisture to help trees regrow. That means some forests burn, then never grow back, converting instead into shrub land more adapted to frequent fire, said Jonathan Thompson, a senior ecologist at Harvard University.\n\"They get stuck in this trap of repeated, high-severity fire,\" Thompson said. \"Through time we'll see the California shrub land shifting north.\"\nSimilar shifts are being observed in Colorado, Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park in Montana, he said.\nThe relationship between climate and fire cuts both ways. A longer fire season and bigger fires in the boreal forests of Alaska and Canada are burning not just trees but also tundra and organic matter in soils, which hold roughly a third of the Earth's terrestrial carbon, said David Peterson, a former U.S. Forest Service research scientist.\nThe carbon enters the atmosphere and contributes to higher temperatures, leading to bigger fires that release yet more carbon.\nBIRD IN THE BALANCE\nLife and property still top the list of priorities for firefighters, but in recent years another asset has been deemed worth extra protection in many Western states: a chicken-sized bird known as the greater sage grouse.\nFires burned an estimated 3,240 square miles (8,390 square kilometers) of the bird's sage bush habitat in 2017 and have burned almost 2,400 square miles (6,215 square kilometers) so far in 2018.\nWhen sage brush burns, it's often replaced with a plant from Europe called cheatgrass, which crowds out native plants and is more prone to burning.\nThat's challenging government efforts to keep greater sage grouse off the endangered species list, which could restrict economic development.\nAreas considered crucial to the bird's survival now get extra attention: A military-type Blackhawk helicopter is under government contract to deploy quick-reaction teams to snuff out sage brush fires in portions of Idaho, Nevada, Utah and Oregon.\nREGENERATION\nA turning point in public understanding of the ecological importance of fire came in 1988 , when 1,240 square miles (3,200 square kilometers) of Yellowstone National Park burned.\nThe devastation, punctuated by images of wildlife fleeing flames, fed into the perception of wildfires as a menace to be battled.\nThe events drew criticism of the park's \"let it burn\" policy. Officials didn't immediately squelch lightning-caused fires that June because they did not pose an immediate threat to life or property, but eventually ended up deploying 10,000 firefighters.\nBy that fall, seedlings already were emerging in some burned out areas. Park biologist Roy Renkin recalls a visitor reacting with surprise a decade later when he told her a thick stand of young trees emerging from a burned area had come back on their own.\nLodgepole pines are commonly cited as an example of forest resiliency. The fire's heat releases seeds from the pine's cones.\nSeveral species of woodpeckers thrive on insects attracted to fire-killed trees. A plant called fireweed is specially adapted to take root in fire-damaged soils, multiplying rapidly and forming carpets of pink petals against a blackened backdrop.\n\"It's isn't all death and destruction,\" Renkin said. \"These forests have evolved with fire.\"\n___\nFollow AP's wildfire coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/Wildfires"}

Most observers see the real issues as China\u2019s thirst for regional power and Nauru\u2019s alliance with Taiwan.\nThe 2018 Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) is being held on Nauru, which covers about eight square miles of land area and has a population of just 11,000. Even so, Nauru is not the smallest of the 18 participants in the event. That honor goes to Niue, which has only 1,600 citizens. (The largest participant, as geography aficionados might guess, is Australia.)\nVarious observers and partner nations are also invited to send representatives, including the United Nations, the World Bank, the United States, and China.\nMuch attention has been paid to Nauru\u2019s selection as the host of this year\u2019s forum because the island, currently celebrating its 50th year of independence, has a spotty economic and political history. In the past, Nauru has been accused of laundering money for Russian gangsters and selling passports to shady characters. At the moment, it generates much of its national income by warehousing 900 refugees for Australia in notoriously poor living conditions. The island\u2019s government has been criticized for corruption and lack of transparency to the press.\nAs Chinese media rarely fail to note, Nauru diplomatically recognizes Taiwan despite China\u2019s efforts to isolate and delegitimize the island nation. Even before the Pacific Islands Forum began, Nauru enraged Beijing by refusing to stamp the diplomatic passports of the Chinese delegation. China\u2019s representatives were allowed to enter the island using their personal passports.\nSeveral island nations with strong diplomatic and financial ties to China threatened to boycott the forum in response to this perceived slight. Nauru ultimately compromised by allowing the Chinese delegates to use their visa-acceptance letters in lieu of passports.\nOn Tuesday, Chinese representative Du Qiwen, the Chinese ambassador to Fiji, indicated he wanted to address the PIF about climate change. President Waqa refused, stating that China\u2019s representative was insulting the assembled nations by demanding to speak before all of the actual attendees had their time on stage.\n\u201cHe insisted, and was very insolent about it, and created a big fuss and held up the meeting of leaders for a good number of minutes when he was only an official. Maybe because he was from a big country he wanted to bully us,\u201d Waqa said on Tuesday.\n\u201cWould he behave like that in front of his own president? I doubt it,\u201d Waqa said of the Chinese representative at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\u201cHe disrespected the Pacific, the forum island leaders and other ministers who have come to join us in our territory,\u201d Waqa continued. \u201cAre you kidding? Look at him, he\u2019s a nobody. He\u2019s not even a minister and he\u2019s demanding to be recognized and to speak before the prime minister of Tuvalu. Is he crazy?\u201d\nWaqa demanded a formal apology from China and vowed to bring up the incident at every United Nations event and international meeting until he receives satisfaction. PIF members are also discussing plans to shift important business between island nations to events where foreign observers will not be invited.\n\u201cNever mind they are bigger than us, but they should not disrespect us,\u201d Waqa said of China.\n\u201cI have to be strong for our members because no one is to come and dictate to us.

But the absence of guidelines for meeting that goal has led to fears that not enough action is being taken.\nThere have been notable disagreements over fair financing for implementation of the rules by developing countries, and the technical details of their reporting on progress.\nPatricia Espinosa, executive secretary for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said Sunday at the closing press briefing for the Bangkok meeting that progress was made on most issues but nothing was finalized.\nThe meeting was attended by representatives of most of the countries party to the Paris agreement, as well as the United States, which has announced that it is pulling out of the pact.\nEspinosa said there was \"limited progress\" on the issue of contributions from developed nations to developing countries, adding that she is \"hopeful\" that future discussions will be productive because of the importance of the issue.\n\"On the core issues of forward-looking climate finance and the degree of flexibility developing countries should be given on the information and reporting requirements for national commitments under the Paris Agreement, negotiators were stalemated in Bangkok,\" said a statement from Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a U.S.-based activist group.\n\"It's now up to the incoming Polish presidency and officials leading negotiations to find ways to bridge the deep differences on these issues and to secure agreement in Katowice on a robust, comprehensive package of rules to implement the Paris Agreement,\" he said.\nHarjeet Singh, climate policy manager for ActionAid International, said Sunday that a vital component of the Paris agreement is for wealthy nations to provide financial assistance to developing countries as they fight natural disasters brought by climate change.\nBut he said wealthy and developed countries \"led by the United States and including countries such as Australia, Japan and even the European Union\" refused to clearly show \"how much money they are going to provide and how that is going to be counted.\"\nAdvocacy for the developing countries was led at the meeting by China, said Meyer, but was also supported by others, including India, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.\nActivists were critical of Washington's lobbying at the meeting, especially because President Donald Trump has announced plans to have the U.S. withdraw from the Paris pact, which had been heavily promoted by his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\"The U.S. has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement but still negotiates as if it is a Party, weakening international cooperation by not contributing to finance and technology transfer to developing countries,\" Meena Raman, legal adviser at Third World Network, said in an emailed statement.\nClimate change is a polarizing issue in the United States, and some states and local communities have announced policies supporting the Paris agreement.\nThousands of governors, mayors, company CEOs and civil society leaders are expected to gather this week in San Francisco for the Global Climate Action Summit."}

If they\u2019re really lucky, it will fulfil the Washington Post\u2018s burning desire for winds so strong they merit an entirely new category:\nIn little more than a day, Hurricane Florence exploded in strength, jumping from a Category 1 to a Category 4 behemoth with 140 mph winds. This process \u2014 hurricanes intensifying fast \u2014 is both extremely dangerous and poorly understood. But new research says that as the climate continues to warm, storms will do it faster and more often, and in some extreme cases, grow so powerful that they might arguably be labeled \u201cCategory 6.\u201d\nAs usual WaPo\u2019s resident climate hysteric Chris Mooney is talking rubbish.\nRoy Spencer puts him right on this blogpost: you can\u2019t talk about worsening hurricanes when the trend shows the opposite:\nAttendees of the conference are almost guaranteed to point to Florence as an example of what we can expect more of with global warming. But it\u2019s curious how there hasn\u2019t been a statistically significant increase in major hurricane strikes in the Carolinas (based upon NHC data), even assuming Florence hits as a Cat3+: (The same is true in Florida.) The 1950s was the stand-out decade for major hurricane strikes in the Carolinas, with Hurricane Hazel in 1954 doing major damage, even as far north as Toronto. Hazel\u2019s destruction of Myrtle Beach, SC led to a massive rebuilding effort that transformed that community forever. For sure, there has been an increase in hurricane damages over time, as infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coasts has increased dramatically. There is simply more stuff for Mother Nature to destroy. But I doubt that the luminaries attending the Global Climate Action Summit this week can understand that increasing damages would occur even without any climate change.\nSteven Goddard is on the case too \u2013 and has a few pertinent points to make. (He has also made an excellent video)\nAccording to Roger Pielke Jr., east coast major hurricanes are down more than 60% over the past 50 years. The US is just coming off the longest hurricane drought on record.\nMeanwhile, the Washington Post is trying to pin responsibility for this weather event on Donald Trump:\nYet when it comes to extreme weather, Mr. Trump is complicit. He plays down humans\u2019 role in increasing the risks, and he continues to dismantle efforts to address those risks. It is hard to attribute any single weather event to climate change. But there is no reasonable doubt that humans are priming the Earth\u2019s systems to produce disasters.\nBut as Goddard (aka Tony Heller) notes, if it\u2019s really true that U.S. Presidents have the power to create hurricanes, then the worst living offender is George W Bush. The really bad ones are quite beyond the reach of even the most astringent WaPo editorial\u2026"}
{"headline": "california vs. trump: new state laws take on climate change and white house energy agenda", "body": "The Trump administration and lawmakers in California have seemingly been at odds from the day the president took office. Last weekend, their long-running battled moved to the seas.\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown put his signature on two pieces of legislation over weekend that effectively ban the construction of any new offshore oil and gas pipelines in the state\u2019s waters and thwart a Trump plan to open nearly 1.7 billion acres of coastal waters to drilling.\n\u201cToday, California\u2019s message to the Trump administration is simple: Not here, not now,\u201d Brown said at the signing of SB 834 and AB 1775. \u201cWe will not let the federal government pillage public lands and destroy our treasured coast.\u201d\nThe new laws represent California\u2019s latest strike against the Trump administration\u2019s energy agenda and its moves to dismantle Obama-era climate regulations. Together, they continue a trend of state officials here working to combat the White House on everything from land use to immigration.\n\u201cCalifornia has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance,\u201d Jessica Levinson, a clinical law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s bloody combat.\u201d\nIssues like sanctuary cities and other immigration-related matters have been front and center in the California-versus-Trump fight, given the president\u2019s focus on cracking down on illegal immigration and building a border wall.\nBut there is perhaps no other area where Brown and state Attorney General Xavier Becerra have been more effective at resisting the White House\u2019s agenda than the environment.\nWhile California cannot directly block oil and gas drilling off its coast, the legislation that Brown signed last weekend aims to drive up the operating costs of these operations enough to make the effort unprofitable. The new law does this by blocking state land managers from permitting the construction of new pipelines, piers, wharves or other infrastructure projects necessary to bring oil and gas from offshore drilling sites to land.\nIn a state where 69 percent of the population opposes drilling, according to a recent poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California, the new laws were praised by many conservation groups.\n\u201cWe are extremely pleased,\u201d said Kim Delfino, the California program director of Defenders of Wildlife, according to The Mercury News. \u201cThe bills are intended to make it difficult to bring any new oil to shore, so it makes any new offshore oil drilling unlikely.\n\"They put up a pretty significant obstacle. They don\u2019t make it economically feasible for an oil company to do new drilling.\u201d\nThe legislation, however, also created some strange bedfellows, as it was panned by both oil industry insiders and some environmental groups, who called Brown a hypocrite.\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is incredibly ironic since Brown has refused every effort by hundreds of community groups to get him to slow the pace of new permits for oil wells,\u201d 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben said in a statement.\nCalifornia banned offshore drilling in state waters out to three miles back in 1994 and there haven\u2019t been any new platforms built in the last 30 years. But California is the nation\u2019s third-largest oil-producing state, behind Texas and North Dakota, and there are still 32 offshore oil platforms and artificial islands in federal and state waters off the coasts of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange Counties.\nBrown has himself approved more than 20,000 new drilling permits across the state since 2011 \u2013 although fewer than 1,500 of those have been issued in the last two years \u2013 and his previous gubernatorial campaigns have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil giants like Chevron and Occidental.\nDespite the cries of hypocrisy, California \u2013 under Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2013 is dedicated to fighting back against the White House\u2019s energy agenda.\nCalifornia already has a waiver under the federal Clean Air Act allowing it to impose tougher emission standards than the U.S. rules, which runs counter to the Trump administration\u2019s move to roll back Obama-era rules focused on curbing greenhouse gas emissions. It is also one of 17 states suing the Trump administration over the rollback.\nAs he prepared to host a summit of climate change leaders from around the world in San Francisco (starting Wednesday), Brown earlier this week also signed legislation phasing out electricity in the state produced by fossil fuels by 2045\n\"We want others to do likewise, and if enough people often enough do what is needed we will curb global warming,\" Brown said during an interview with The Associated Press. \"But we're definitely at the beginning of what's going to be a long and difficult and contentious journey.\"\nIn filing suit against the Trump administration over emissions standards \u2013 and over the federal census, and over separation of migrant families, and over regulations on small business health insurance policies, and in more than three dozen other lawsuits \u2013 Brown, Becerra and other Democratic lawmakers in California are taking a page from the playbook of Texas Republicans.\nDuring the Obama administration, Texas filed so many lawsuits against the White House that the state Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is now the governor, joked that \u201cI go to the office in the morning, I sue Barack Obama, and then I go home.\u201d\nAnd with the demographics of California continually shifting in favor of the Democrats and the administration not looking to drastically shift its own agenda, experts say that the Golden State and the White House look to be at odds for the foreseeable future.\n\u201cThe marriage is broken and we\u2019re in litigation right now,\u201d Levinson said. \u201cNeither side has any motivation to back down.\u201d"}

It is a way to love our neighbour and to steward the gift of creation.\u201d\nThe Archbishop of Cape Town, Thabo Makgoba, said in his letter that climate change is changing rain patterns in Southern Africa, whereas in Namibia, Swaziland, and South Africa \u201cthe greatest impact has been that of crippling drought.\u201d\n\u201cThe actions that we take in the next five years are crucial to stop us from reaching the tipping point where climate change becomes unstoppable,\u201d Makgoba said. \u201cLook into the eyes of your children and grandchildren and do what you need to do to preserve the world for their future.\u201d\nThe Diocese of Polynesia in the Anglican Church of Aotearoa, New Zealand, and Polynesia (ANZP) is part of the world which is one of the most badly affected by climate change. \u201cIsland nations are being impacted by sea level rising due to Climate Change,\u201d the former Bishop of Polynesia, Winston Halapua, said, adding that because of climate change, \u201cTuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands are threatened with non-existence as the sea level rises and land becomes uninhabitable.\u201d\nLeaders from the Pacific today are reading the signs of the times, Halapua said. \u201cThey are being motivated to speak and act so that world wakes up to the need to address the human greed and exploitation which contribute to Climate Change \u2013 to address abuse of Creation.\u201d\nThe Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, Philip Freier, said that the \u201cunique ecological tapestry\u201d of Australia makes it \u201cparticularly vulnerable to climate change.\u201d\nExtreme weather events such as drought, floods, and serious bush/wildfires have been \u201cdangerously exacerbated by human-induced climate change with an increase in the number and seriousness of events in recent years,\u201d he said.\nThe Presiding Bishop of the U.S.-based Episcopal Church, Michael Curry, on the other hand, called upon the worldwide Anglican Communion to unite in the common enterprise of climate action.\n\u201cWe can maintain a vigorous and effective commitment, and empower Anglicans everywhere to undertake bold action to mitigate and reverse climate change,\u201d he said.\nFollow Thomas D.

The majority of Iran\u2019s mostly arid land mass and population centres are located to the south and east of them.\nAccording to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization, Iran, a country of some 80 million people, predominantly relies on agriculture.\n\u2013 Past errors \u2013\nKalantari said there had been many years of mismanagement of water resources, and mistaken decisions forced by political and economic concerns such as the US sanctions and climate change.\n\u201cWe basically thought that environment was not that important,\u201d he said.\nOther countries had also failed to address climate issues introducing policy errors in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\u201cWe made these mistakes in the 1980s. Then we came to realise that in places that we\u2019d built dams, we shouldn\u2019t have built any, and in places where we should have built dams, we didn\u2019t build any,\u201d he said.\nThe pressure on the country\u2019s resources has also been exacerbated by population growth, with Iranians encouraged to have large families in the years following its 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\u201cIn the first decade after the revolution, we encountered a high population growth rate, more than three percent annually,\u201d Kalantari said.\nThis policy was taken \u201cwithout paying attention to utilising and improving\u201d the use of resources, he said.\nHe also highlighted the effects of the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988), when the country was isolated and could not concern itself with sustainable development as it had a burgeoning population to feed.\n\u201cIran could not, and cannot, bear the pressure that this (population growth) exerted on the consumption of water, for the supply of food and for agriculture,\u201d he added.\nThe strain has shown recently with Iranians taking to the streets in December and January this year, protesting over economic conditions.\nA former agriculture minister in the 1990s, Kalantari said Iran could not be self-sufficient in food production for its estimated 80 million people \u201cif we want sustainable policies\u201d.\nEven with state-of-the-art technology, Iran could only be completely self-sufficient to supply food for 50 to 55 million people.\n\u2013 Sanctions hit \u2013\nHe also blamed some of the country\u2019s air pollution woes on biting sanctions.\n\u201cLocally-produced car engines are not up to standard, so when sanctions are imposed, car manufacturers such as Peugeot and Renault depart,\u201d said Kalantari.\nThe two carmakers suspended operations in Iran after Washington withdrew from a ground-breaking nuclear deal earlier this year and reimposed sanctions, as European leaders have so far failed to gain any exemptions for their firms.\nA lack of new cars prompts Iranians to \u201cuse domestically-made engines\u201d which do not adhere to modern environmental standards.\nThe resulting pollution frequently hangs heavily over the capital Tehran, with smog often rendering the mountains to the north invisible, while there have been growing cases of people hospitalised with respiratory problems."}

It would also cut down on species loss and extinction and reduce the impact on various ecosystems.\n\u201cThere were doubts if we would be able to differentiate impacts set at 1.5 C and that came so clearly. Even the scientists were surprised to see how much science was already there and how much they could really differentiate and how great are the benefits of limiting global warming at 1.5 compared to 2,\u201d Thelma Krug, vice-chair of the IPCC, told Reuters. \u201cAnd now more than ever we know that every bit of warming matters.\u201d\nWith Post Wires\nThis story originally appeared in the New York Post."}

Anyone could show that any risk \u201cmay increase\u201d just by demonstrating that it is possible. Whether it is probable is another question.\nTrying to quantify future possibilities is a notoriously tricky business.\nResearchers combined flood area and flood depth and \u201cfound the flood risk index under the worst-case scenario to increase by up to 50% until 2100 across the region,\u201d CNN declares, while the maximum flood depth \u201cmay rise by 290% across the region.\u201d\nOne surmises it may also rise by 350 percent, or then again, it may not rise at all.\nMoreover, while analyzing the potential damage to WTSs by erosion and sea level rise, the study never bothers to try to link these tangible events to the rather more ethereal construct known as anthropogenic climate change.\nThe researchers seem to take for granted that if sea level rises, climate change must be behind it.\nAnd yet, while describing the dangers faced by the Italian city of Venice from rising sea levels, CNN inadvertently concedes that this is nothing new and can hardly be blamed on \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\u201cIn reality, Venice floods regularly, and has done so for centuries,\u201d CNN observes.\nUnfortunately, both the CNN piece and the study inspiring it read much like the glossy brochures of slick fundraisers, urging immediate action to preserve treasures from imminent disaster.\nThe climate fundraisers have the added bonus of human guilt to encourage people and nations to dig deep into their pockets. If damage to historic sites were merely a natural meteorological affair \u2014 an \u201cact of god\u201d \u2014 no one would be responsible.

But the $4 million the Bloomberg is spending on attack ads against Rohrabacher, and to help Democrat challenger Harley Rouda, makes it the most expensive.\nRohrabacher is a conservative known for his tough stands on many key issues, including immigration \u2014 but also for his passionate advocacy for the legalization of marijuana. (Last week, Breitbart News accompanied Rohrabacher on a trip with a busload of senior citizens to a marijuana dispensary.) Democrats have attacked him for favoring more cordial relations with Russia, a position that was held by Barack Obama for the first six years of his administration.\nRecently, Rohrabacher took a slim lead in the polls, though the race is still considered a dead heat. Rohrabacher trounced his rival in a debate on local public television, as Rouda could not shake off the fact that he had proposed giving free Medicare to illegal aliens. Footage also emerged of the Democrat and his campaign complaining and threatening to quit the debate because the congressman had brought notes with him into the television studio.\nBloomberg, a major funder of gun control efforts around the country, is spending $100 million to elect Democrats in 2018. His first ad targets Rohrabacher on the issue of climate change, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nRohrabacher\u2019s campaign responded to the Times: \u201c\u201cBillionaires from San Francisco and New York City are pouring millions of dollars into this district to buy the election for Nancy Pelosi and advance their own personal agendas. \u2026 Their attack ads are intended [to] mislead and to distort Rep. Rohrabacher\u2019s record. It won\u2019t work.\u201d\nThe Times also noted that so much money is being spent on ads targeting Rohrabacher that he has effectively been crowded out of local broadcast television markets: \u201cOn Thursday, Rouda, the Bloomberg group and a Democratic super PAC were all airing ads pounding Rohrabacher on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox stations with no counter-spots defending the congressman.\u201d\nDespite the strong challenge, Rohrabacher has been jovial throughout the election, confident that he can win if he keeps fighting. Earlier this year, he helped efforts by conservative activists throughout Orange County to encourage their local governments to dissent from the state\u2019s \u201csanctuary\u201d laws. He also voted against President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cut, because the cap on state and local tax deductions could hurt some local property owners.\nRohrabacher, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, has represented the 48th district for decades.\nJoel B.

A warmer atmosphere will be more volatile and hazardous, with extreme events like heatwaves becoming increasingly frequent, intense and widespread.\"\nThe researchers looked at the red flour beetle to get the effects of simulated heatwaves on male reproduction. They were exposed to standard control conditions or a five-day heatwave where the temperatures ranged between 5\u00b0C and 7\u00b0C \"above their thermal optimum,\" the statement added.\nAs a result, the researchers learned that the climate-controlled group had no problems reproducing, but those that were exposed to the harsher conditions suffered serious setbacks.

We wanted to know why this happens. And one answer could be related to sperm.\"\nAfter the rise in temperatures, sperm count fell by three-quarters and \"any sperm produced then struggled to migrate into the female tract and were more likely to die before fertilization,\" according to the statement.\nFemales, however, were not affected by the warmer conditions.\n\"Our research shows that heatwaves halve male reproductive fitness, and it was surprising how consistent the effect was,\" said Kirs Sales, a postgraduate researcher who led the research.\nWhile concerning in the short-term, there are significant longer-term implications as well, with Sales citing \"the impacts of heatwaves on future generations.\"\nTHIS COFFIN-SHAPED ICEBERG IS HEADED TO DIE\n\"When males were exposed to two heatwave events 10 days apart, their offspring production was less than 1 percent of the control group,\" Sales said. \"Insects in nature are likely to experience multiple heatwave events, which could become a problem for population productivity if male reproduction cannot adapt or recover.\"\nOf the offspring that did survive, they lived a shorter life-span, up to a few months shorter, the researcher found. There were also problems with male offspring, as some were found to be less fertile as a result of their fathers' exposure to the heatwave-like conditions.\nBeetles are believed to represent a quarter of biodiversity, Sales added, making these results concerning for how other species will react to climate change.\n\"Research has also shown that heat shock can damage male reproduction in warm-blooded animals too, and past work has shown that this leads to infertility in mammals,\" Sales added.\nFollow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia"}

The first, released in November 2017, concluded that there is \u201cno convincing alternative explanation\u201d for the changing climate other than \u201chuman activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases.\u201d\nThe report includes predictions of dire consequences from climate change, including people dying because of increased temperatures.\n\u201cHigher temperatures will also kill more people, the report says,\u201d CNN reported. \u201cThe Midwest alone, which is predicted to have the largest increase in extreme temperature, will see an additional 2,000 premature deaths per year by 2090.\u201d\nThe report also said there would be more insect-borne diseases, including West Nile cases, which could more than double by 2050.\nThe report covers climate change scenarios nationally and regionally and also discusses \u201creducing risks through adaptation actions\u201d and \u201creducing risks through emissions mitigation.\u201d\nBut perhaps the most striking revelation in the huge report is that it offers no specific solutions to its speculated scenarios.\n\u201cThe report was created to inform policy-makers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem,\u201d CNN reported. \u201cHowever, it suggests that if the United States immediately reduced its fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, it could save thousands of lives and generate billions of dollars in benefits for the country.\u201d\nThe report also notes, ironically, how difficult it is to predict future climate.\n\u201cScientific ability to predict the climate at the seasonal to decadal scale is limited both by the imperfect ability to specify the initial conditions of the state of the ocean (such as surface temperature and salinity) and the chaotic nature of the interconnected earth system,\u201d the report states.\nThe left is calling the report a rebuke to President Donald Trump, who has said proof of manmade climate change is not conclusive, including leftist climate change guru Al Gore.\n\u201cThe president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible,\u201d Gore said in a statement on Friday.\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter"}

Scientists aren't positive precisely how events played out, but the runaway greenhouse effect that resulted is beyond debate: Venus now clocks in at a staggering 880 degrees Fahrenheit (471 degrees Celsius).\n\"I think Venus is an important warning: Greenhouse atmospheres are not theoretical,\" Ellen Stofan, director of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum and former chief scientist at NASA, told Space.com. And in fact, Venus has already warned us about a climate threat \u2014 Stofan said that it was studying our neighbor that prompted scientists to look for an ozone hole here on Earth. They found it, and in perhaps the only veritable climate success, international agreements have cut production of the compounds that eat away at ozone. [Japan at Venus: Photos from the Akatsuki Spacecraft's Mission]\nMuch of the appeal of Venus comes from the fact that despite its horrifying modern appearance, it's actually really similar to Earth. \"Picture a planet that's just like Earth but it's a little hotter because it's a little closer to the sun \u2014 and that would be Venus,\" David Grinspoon, a planetary scientist and astrobiologist at the Planetary Science Institute, told Space.com.\nAlong with Mars, these planets form a trio of worlds that began with comparable sizes, materials and temperatures \u2014 until suddenly, they were very different. Once upon a time, Venus, like Earth today, was covered in water, perhaps even habitable. Then, gradually, something fell out of whack. \"The basic mechanism is very simple: Everybody knows that if you heat up water you make steam,\" Grinspoon said. And water vapor is a powerful greenhouse gas, trapping still more heat. \"There's nothing to really stop it until the oceans fully evaporate.\" (Today, Venus' atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide; radiation from the sun likely broke up the water vapor, letting it escape into space.)\nThe divergent paths of Earth and its two neighbors pose an existential dilemma more powerful even than anthropogenic climate change: Humans or no, Earth's cozy environment won't last forever, either. \"We think of habitability like, 'Oh, you have a habitable planet and it just stays that way,'\" Stofan said. \"Habitability can be very transient in a planet's history.\" Of the three, Earth's habitability window has lasted the longest, and Venus' was probably shorter than Mars, but scientists aren't yet sure by just how much, she added.\nAt a strictly intellectual level, data from Venus and Mars about how a planet and its atmosphere affect each other can be more intriguing than terrestrial data. \"For a geologist, Venus is such a great planet because you have geology and you have the atmosphere and they're interacting with each other in a really interesting way without the mess of the biosphere,\" Stofan said. \"It's kind of like a pure planet, which for a geologist is really fun.\"\nBut while Earth's biosphere may be intellectually annoying, we're all awfully fond of it, and that's a powerful reason to care about climates on other worlds. \"It's no longer just a luxury because we're curious,\" Grinspoon said. \"It's become an essential survival tool for us now.\"\nClimate scientists are the first to tell you they want more data, more models, more to dig their teeth into. Some types of climate information does go back millennia, like the details trapped in columns of sediment that scientists can pull from the ocean floor, but climate data is skewed heavily toward modern years. [Amazing Venus Photos by ESA's Venus Express]\nSo doubling the number of planets you're looking at \u2014 even with limited data \u2014 makes a difference. \"[Venus is] a laboratory for understanding climate physics and climate change on an Earth-like planet,\" Grinspoon said. \"You can't learn everything you need to know about climate change on Earth by only studying Earth.\"\nAnd unlike climate here on Earth, the same interactions on Venus don't have the kind of emotional drama attached to them. That means that Venus doesn't just offer new information \u2014 it also offers a new way of talking about climate, even with those who have taken an ideological stand against findings here on Earth.\n\"I've had some conversations with people in that camp that have been fruitful because I've used the example of Venus,\" Grinspoon said. \"It allows you to sort of reframe the question \u2014 you're not just talking about policy choices on Earth. \u2026 It's not a cure-all for that difficult conversation, but I do think it can help.\"\nWhatever humans do or do not choose to do about Earth's climate, someday countless years from now, as the sun swells in its old age, our world will travel the same path as Venus, with the oceans evaporating away into a runaway greenhouse world. By then, climate won't be a problem for any of us, but it's still a poignant reminder of what science can tell us about the world.\n\"I'm not saying, 'Oh, that's about to happen to Earth,'\" Grinspoon said. \"But the overall lesson still stands that climate stability is not something you can take for granted.\"\nOriginal article on Space.com."}

If it is, we know exactly whom to thank.\nAccording to the green publication Clean Technica, in an article headlined \u201cG20 Nations Reportedly Set to Kowtow to Trump on Climate Change\u201d:\nA reported draft version of a communique being formulated by leaders of the G20 in advance of the 13th meeting of Group of Twenty to be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, starting Friday, fails to back the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and makes no mention of the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C which warned that \u201cLimiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.\u201d \u2026 Further, the draft nods in the direction of those countries intent on defending their continued use of coal, saying that there are \u201cvaried\u201d energy choices and \u201cdifferent possible national pathways.\u201d Further highlighting the weakening stance of G20 nations\u2019 willingness to stand up to climate obstructionists like the United States and Australia, there is no mention of the IPCC\u2019s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C which was published earlier this year and which warned that \u201cLimiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.\u201d There is also no mention of the upcoming COP24 climate talks to be held in Katowice, Poland, starting a day after the G20 meeting ends on Saturday. There was some hint of the possibility of a weakening of the G20\u2019s stance on climate change earlier this month, when Argentina\u2019s G20 sherpa (emissary) Pedro Villagra Delgado spoke to the media, saying that the drafting of this communique, and the section referencing the Paris Climate Agreement, was proving to be the \u201cmost complicated\u201d aspect. \u201cOf course, we want the Paris Agreement to be mentioned, but we want it to be mentioned, encompassing everyone, albeit in an ambiguous way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States does not say that nothing should be done [about climate change], but that they do not want to have neither the obligations nor the goals imposed by the Paris Agreement.\u201d \u201cThe more assertive mentions are made, the more likely it is that the United States will stay away from it,\u201d he concluded.\nIt helps, of course, that President Donald Trump now has a major ally in the G20. President-elect Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil is not attending the summit, but the very fact of his election means that, for the first time, there are two avowedly climate-skeptical nations in the G20. Bolsonaro, who sees himself as South America\u2019s answer to Trump, recently appointed a foreign minister \u2014 Ernesto Ara\u00fajo \u2014 who believes that \u201cclimate change\u201d is a plot by \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d to stifle the economies of the West and promote the growth of China.\nBrazil was supposed to be hosting the COP25 climate talks next year, but since Bolsonaro\u2019s election, it has announced that it is no longer interested \u201cdue to the transition in government and budget restrictions.\u201d\nThis marks a highly significant and symbolic turnaround in global warming geopolitics. It was nearly thirty years ago in Brazil \u2014 at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 \u2014 that the great global warming scare really began to take off when the leaders of over 100 nations flew to Rio de Janeiro and established the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This, in turn, led to the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement and all those annual COP meetings like the one that Brazil has just decided it no longer wants to host.\nSure, this is not the end of the global climate change scam. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."}

{"headline": "why i'm always telling lies about climate change...", "body": "The only reason I write articles attacking the irrefutable science of \u201cclimate change\u201d is that I am paid such vast sums to lie. Besides the stupendous salary I get from Breitbart News, I also receive generous retainers from the oil industry and the tobacco industry, which, for reasons of crass right-wing ideology or crude economic self-interest, require me to churn out propaganda stories, day in day out, insisting that global warming is a myth.\nNo, not really.\nI doubt even many leftists or greens would be stupid enough to believe that this were so.\nFirst, most of the money is on the other side of the argument, so why would I bother shilling for relative paupers when I could be coining it in from the $1.5 trillion-plus Climate Industrial Complex churning out lucrative global warming bilge for the Guardian, the BBC, or the New York Times and being flown out to endless environmental conferences to sit on panels bewailing the selfishness and greed of people who fly too much?\nSecond, like a lot of journalists, I\u2019m quite lazy. Why would I put myself through the stress of faking scientific articles and torturing data and pretending to take people like Michael Mann seriously when it\u2019s so much easier just to print the truth?\nThird, okay, so where are my stables, my string of hunters, my sexy girl groom and under groom, my villa in Tuscany, etc?\nFourth, anyone who would make such an allegation clearly doesn\u2019t understand journalism. We don\u2019t go into it for the money. Otherwise, by now, we\u2019d have made the transition to corporate PR. We do it \u2013 bizarrely \u2013 because we actually believe in this shit we do.\nFifth, I would have been rumbled by now. Conservative commentators are always held to much higher standards by our left-biased media culture. So if I were just printing anti-global warming stuff for monetary gain, the flaws in my feeble arguments would certainly have been cruelly exposed by doughty left-leaning investigators, and everybody would have long since ceased to take my commentary seriously.\nBut suppose if, despite all the above, I really were doing it just to please my nefarious funding sources; here\u2019s the clincher: it wouldn\u2019t matter a damn anyway.\nWhy wouldn\u2019t it matter?\nBecause facts are facts, logic is logic, truth is truth, and everything else is for the birds.\nThe claims I make in my pieces are verifiable, well sourced, often illustrated with helpful graphs, linked to scientific studies, and abundant with quotations from experts in the field.\nSo whether I\u2019m paid a billion dollars a day for writing this stuff or I\u2019m doing it for free is entirely irrelevant. If you want to go ahead and refute my facts and my arguments, feel free to refute my facts and arguments. They\u2019ll remain valid facts and valid arguments regardless of what you think of me personally or of my funding sources.\nI mention all this by way of introduction to a fascinating debate I saw on Twitter recently, which I want to share with you because it goes to the heart of perhaps the biggest and most dangerous challenge to conservatives right now: our increasingly tough struggle to make our voices heard in a world which is trying to close us all down.\nIt started with a tweet by economist, philosophical thinker, and author, Jamie Whyte:\nI am leaving the IEA as of 1 Jan 2019. I will miss it. But I won't miss the endless \"who funds you?\" tweets. They reveal a profound misunderstanding of the kind of people who work at think tanks and what motivates them. And always irrelevant to the issue at hand. So stupid. \u2014 Jamie Whyte (@_JamieWhyte) December 27, 2018\nAs listeners to my podcasts will know, the IEA, Institute of Economic Affairs, is one of my favorite London think tanks. From the fake news \u201cgender pay gap\u201d to the Nanny State\u2019s war on sugar, salt, fat, fun, and freedom, the IEA is one of our greatest intellectual redoubts against the creeping menace of ever-bigger government.\nThat\u2019s why it is constantly being plagued with the \u201cWho funds you?\u201d question from its leftist critics. They don\u2019t like its arguments but find them too difficult to refute. So, instead, they opt for the smear tactic of making out that its arguments are somehow corrupted by its donors.\nWhyte has written about this logical fallacy before. He calls it the \u201cmotive fallacy.\u201d\nAs he puts it in his excellent book Bad Thoughts: \u201cA man may stand to gain a great deal of peace and quiet from telling his wife that he loves her. But he may really love her nevertheless.\u201d\nWhyte reiterates this point with his usual clarity here:\nMany people on Twitter wonder how they can trust me, gven that they do not know who funds me. But I have never asked for people to take my opinions on trust. If my arguments are no good, tell me where they go wrong. My income and its sources are irrelevant. \u2014 Jamie Whyte (@_JamieWhyte) December 28, 2018\nYes. So why is it that the people on the left \u2013 and it is almost always people on the left \u2013 cannot understand this?\nAnd I\u2019m not just talking about stupid or NPC-level people on the left, either.\nHere is a left-leaning commentator and author I normally admire weighing into the fray. His name is Jeremy Duns, and one of the reasons I usually respect him is that he strives hard not to let his instinctive political impulses cloud his judgment. For example, he has proved an extremely trenchant critic of the Corbynista sock puppet, Owen Jones \u2013 an easy thing for those of us on the right to do but a much braver and more original line for someone on the left to take:\nHis claim to be asking to be judged on the strength of his arguments is nonsense. They publish research. Concealing funding is a masssive red flag, pretending conflicts of interest don't exist even more so. \u2014 Jeremy Duns (@JeremyDuns) December 28, 2018\nEh? The point is that declarations of conflict of interest are there for a reason \u2013 it's not up to the reader to work them out or investigate them, as this works on trust. If you simply refuse to say who funds you, you are essentially boasting about a conflict of interest. \u2014 Jeremy Duns (@JeremyDuns) December 28, 2018\nWhat a tragically pettifogging point on which to stake your credibility as an impartial, thoughtful commentator.\nSure, part of what Duns is arguing here is trivially true: research can be corrupted by funding sources (as we see a lot in, for example, the global warming industry, where so much \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d lol research confirms what the alarmist paymasters wish to hear); if someone refuses to disclose their funding sources, then, yes, that would indeed prompt any neutral observer to be more wary about taking his \u201cfacts\u201d at face value.\nBut so what?\nIn no wise does this refute Whyte\u2019s fundamental point: arguments stand or fall on their own logic, not on the motives or funding or \u201cbad faith\u201d of the people who make them.\nThis might seem a fairly abstruse philosophical point on which to base a 1,500-word article at a time of year when most of us are still struggling to cope with our Christmas hangovers and our preparations for the onslaught of New Year.\nActually, though, I\u2019d say it\u2019s key to almost everything that matters \u2013 perhaps the most important struggle of our times: the battle to preserve plurality of speech.\nIf you\u2019re on the left \u2013 as the IEA\u2019s critics are \u2013 you\u2019re never going to find yourself silenced because of your politics. Not in the politically correct West, at any rate. You\u2019ll be welcomed in academe, in the media, in politics, in big business, in the law \u2013 all of which are now fully on board with the identity politics/social justice/communitarian agenda.\nIf you\u2019re on the right, on the other hand, your every thought and deed is a microaggression potentially punishable by loss of income, loss of credit rating, loss of social acceptability, loss of freedom. Just one expression of an idea that contradicts the politically correct status quo can get you thrown off Twitter or demonetized by Patreon or kicked out of your job or denied promotion or refused work in the first place.\nSo crushingly victorious has the left been in the culture wars, indeed, that many intelligent, reasonable people out there \u2013 Jeremy Duns clearly being one of them \u2013 have come to accept its tyrannical hegemony as normality.\nApparently, it hasn\u2019t even occurred to Duns that there might be very good, morally unimpeachable reasons why an organization like the IEA or the Global Warming Policy Foundation may wish to keep its donor list secret. And the reason it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to him \u2013 and his ilk \u2013 is because, being on the left, he is never once in his life going to experience the kind of prejudice, discrimination, and persecution that is becoming routine for those of us on the right.\nTry earning a living as a conservative journalist, Jeremy, in a climate where even once-conservative newspapers are now squeamish about publishing opinions that the shrill, resurgent left has successfully but unjustly branded \u201chard right.\u201d\nTry getting a novel published when \u2013 as you are, Jeremy \u2013 you are cursed with being white, educated, and middle class, only with the added killer handicap that your politics are deemed insufficiently woke by the social justice warriors who dominate the publishing industry.\nTry \u2013 ditto \u2013 getting yourself heard on TV, except as the token right-wing loon to be doughnutted on a panel by a socialist, a green, and a feminist.\nTry making a crust as a vidcaster or a podcaster or a blogger when, if you\u2019re even remotely conservative, YouTube will demonetize your content and Patreon will deny donors the chance to support you.\nTry being paid to articulate and promulgate free market ideas in a scholarly, published way unless you work within the security of a free market think tank.\nYes, I\u2019m quite, quite sure that the people and organizations who fund free market think tanks have powerful reasons for doing so, sometimes ideological, sometimes financial. But the same goes for the people and organizations that fund left-wing think tanks. The only difference is that the latter are not held up to nearly the same degree of scrutiny.\nWe on the right may deplore the cynicism and hypocrisy and self-serving nature of the likes of George Soros or Tom Steyer in the leftist causes they choose to fund. But we\u2019re not so ideologically blinkered as to imagine that \u201cfunded by Soros\u201d or \u201cfunded by Steyer\u201d or \u201cfunded by the Russians\u201d (as so much anti-fracking industry propaganda is) constitutes an argument sufficiently strong to make our case. Sure, it\u2019s a bit of helpful color, circumstantial evidence which may enhance the case for the prosecution \u2013 or at least prompt like-minded readers to raise their eyebrows in sympathy with our line of attack. But we\u2019d never expect our audience to view it as the clincher because that just wouldn\u2019t be intellectually tenable. It would be as fatuous as trying to insist that dogs are all hateful because Hitler was very fond of his.\nFor the left, on the other hand, \u201cWho funds you?\u201d is more than sufficient to act as judge, jury, and executioner.\nThere are a number of reasons why the left does this, one being that it has a completely different mindset than the right \u2013 one based on emotion and \u201cthe narrative,\u201d rather than on facts and logic. For, say, Antifa or Momentum or your average leftist Twitter bloviator, rightists are so evil that there\u2019s no need to refute their arguments; merely to point and shriek at how wicked they are is more than adequate.\nBut the main reason the left does it is simply because it can.\n\u201cWho funds you?\u201d is not a valid criticism or a credible argument. It means little and proves nothing. Those who care about the future of our civilization, be they on the right or the left, need to recognize it for the ugly, dishonest, mean-spirited, low down, and dirty tactic it truly is: and cover their faces in shame, Jeremy, for ever having imagined otherwise."}

Two other high profile potential 2020 contenders, Sens. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Cory Booker (D-NJ), have also voiced support.\nThe Green New Deal has been hailed by Democrats and liberal pundits as one of the most important proposals to tackle global warming in decades, but don\u2019t be fooled: Many supporters of the Green New Deal know it will do absolutely nothing to reduce global temperature or prevent future temperature rise\u2014the primary purpose of the proposal, according to Ocasio-Cortez. The real goal of the Green New Deal is to impose a series of radical, socialistic programs\u2014policies that would dramatically increase the size and power of the federal government, cause immense harm to the U.S. economy, and run up the national debt by trillions of dollars.\nIn a proposed draft resolution to form a House committee to create legislation for the Green New Deal, Ocasio-Cortez provided important details for her plan. One of the most important elements of the plan is a mandated transition away from fossil fuels in virtually all aspects of American life and the creation of a huge new renewable energy industry. Ocasio-Cortez proposes ending the use of fossil fuels in nearly every industry, including on farms and in all manufacturing, in just 10 years, from 2020 to 2030. Additionally, all power in the United States would need to be produced using renewables, which have been proven on countless occasions to increase the cost of electricity.\nOcasio-Cortez doesn\u2019t stop there, however. In addition to forcing everyone to use renewable energy, thereby closing entire existing energy industries and taking away the jobs of tens of thousands of people, she also proposes \u201cupgrading\u201d every single home and business building in the country, to make them more energy efficient and for \u201ccomfort,\u201d a policy that would likely cost trillions of dollars on its own.\nOcasio-Cortez says the Green New Deal would create a federal jobs guarantee that would \u201cassure a living wage job to every person who wants one,\u201d as well as a single-payer health care program that would put the federal government in charge of the entire health care industry\u2014a plan the Mercatus Center says will cost at least $32 trillion in its first 10 years.\nThe Green New Deal would also form \u201cbasic income programs\u201d and impose all sorts of new workplace requirements, including new \u201cwage standards.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez wants the federal government to lead the charge in this effort, but she also says the legislation should \u201cdeeply involve national and local labor unions to take a leadership role in the process of job training and worker deployment.\u201d\nHow would the government pay for these multiple trillion-dollar programs? By raising taxes and, most importantly, printing money. According to the Green New Deal\u2019s own \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d section (in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s draft resolution), \u201cMany will say, \u2018Massive government investment! How in the world can we pay for this?\u2019 The answer is: in the same ways that we paid for the 2008 bank bailout and extended quantitative easing programs, the same ways we paid for World War II and many other wars. The Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments, new public banks can be created (as in WWII) to extend credit and a combination of various taxation tools (including taxes on carbon and other emissions and progressive wealth taxes) can be employed.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez and other Green New Deal advocates say these proposals are necessary to stop human-caused global warming, but the truth is the Green New Deal would do absolutely nothing to avert future global temperature increases, even if we assume that humans\u2019 carbon-dioxide emissions are the primary cause of climate change and that moderately warmer temperatures would create more harm than good. (Both of these assumptions have been challenged by many highly prominent scientists and economists. For more, see The Heartland Institute\u2019s Climate Change Reconsidered series.) The reason the Green New Deal wouldn\u2019t have the impact its supporters say it will is because the rest of the world is increasing its CO2 emissions at a rate so high that whatever reductions occur in America would be more than offset by increases in other countries, especially China and India.\nOcasio-Cortez and others know the Green New Deal won\u2019t stop climate change, but this plan isn\u2019t really about global warming; it\u2019s about creating massive new government programs that will increase the power of government and move the country closer than ever to socialism.\nThose of us who support free markets and individual liberty must stop the Green New Deal, or else America as we know it will disappear entirely.\nJustin Haskins (@JustinTHaskins) is the executive editor and a research fellow at The Heartland Institute and the editor-in-chief of StoppingSocialism.com."}

Probably no advisory body has been more active than the CCC in pushing forward the green policies which have done so much damage to the British environment and economy, put so much money into the pockets of rent-seeking troughers, and driven up the cost of living, hurting the poorest hardest.\nAll this from a man who makes a big deal of being both a Conservative and a Christian.\nHere are the bare bones of the story:\nTory peer John Selwyn Gummer\u2019s private company has been paid more than \u00a3600,000 from \u2018green\u2019 businesses that stand to make millions from his advice to Ministers. The Conservative grandee heads the Government\u2019s powerful Climate Change Committee that vigorously supports pumping billions of pounds in public subsidies into firms developing environmentally friendly technology. Yet a Mail on Sunday investigation has discovered that his family-run consultancy has been paid huge sums by businesses that have cashed in on those lucrative taxpayer-funded handouts.\nThe Climate Change Committee was established after the Climate Change Act 2008, supposedly as an \u201cindependent\u201d, non-departmental public body to advise the British government on \u201ctackling and preparing for climate change.\u201d\nGummer/Deben has been the head of this body since 2012.\nCan anyone spot why there might be a conflict of interest if such a man starts accepting backhanders financial support from green businesses?\nLet me briefly explain for the benefit of the more stupid #FBPE types and other eco-loons at the back.\nThe Climate Industrial Complex is a $1.5 trillion per year scam industry of no value to mankind \u2014 or indeed the planet \u2014 whatsoever.\nIts business model is built almost entirely on government credulousness.\nBarely a wind turbine would be erected, barely a shimmery solar panel allowed to disfigure the landscape, barely a palm oil plantation planted, barely a bushel of biomass burned, barely a dubious university climate science department funded, barely a first-class airfare to the next COP shindig subsidised, were it not for the government subsidies and regulation which make these fringe, non-commercial and unnecessary activities temporarily viable.\nWhy do governments waste taxpayers\u2019 money on these virtue-signalling frivolities?\nIn part because their expert advisors, such as Gummer/Deben, tell them that in their dispassionate opinion it is necessary in order to save the planet.\nMaybe if that opinion really were dispassionate and informed by science it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\nBut it would appear in this case that other factors may have played a part. Such as the \u00a3600,000 Lord Deben has allegedly received from green vested interests which, understandably, have much to gain from the kind of green government policies Gummer/Deben is forever pushing.\nLord Deben, for the record, is vehemently denying any conflict of interest and insists he has fully complied with disclosure rules.\nWhether he\u2019s going to be able to brazen this one out, though, as he has with previous scandals, looks unlikely\u2026\nLast night Gummer, who was a Tory MP for 40 years before becoming Lord Deben in 2010, was facing calls to resign over what appear to be \u201ccolossal\u201d and \u201cscandalous\u201d conflicts of interest exposed by this newspaper. MPs also demanded an urgent inquiry by Parliament\u2019s standards watchdog. David Davies, the Conservative MP for Monmouth, said: \u201cBased on the information you have given me, he appears to be unfit to hold public office. \u201cAs CCC chairman, he has been playing a hugely influential role, giving evidence to Parliament, making speeches, and issuing reports that have an enormous impact on both policy and household bills.\u201d Labour MP Graham Stringer, a member of the Science and Technology Committee in the Commons, said he was \u201cstaggered and appalled\u201d by the conflict of interest.\nTo get a taste of the man and his hypocrisy, here are a few of his tweets:\nVested interests are very powerful but they can be overcome by the determination of millions who care about their children and grandchildren and refuse to give up till we have repaired the world that we have so gravely injured. https://t.co/GqFdTioknK \u2014 John Deben (@lorddeben) January 23, 2019\nVested interests? lol.\nHistory abounds with evil people who laid waste whole nations to fulfill their selfish ambitions.

Presumably this is because no organisation in the world pushes the climate scare quite as overzealously as the European Union.\nDeben/Gummer really didn\u2019t need to proselytise quite so aggressively and publicly on social media. He could just have taken his \u00a31000 a day fee for his Climate Change Committee \u201cwork\u201d, discreetly pocketed all those, ahem, consultancy fees, and stayed under the radar.\nBut he just couldn\u2019t resist, could he?\nI\u2019m reminded of those serial killers who get so buoyed up by their success that they start leaving clues to taunt the police.\nThey think they\u2019re never going to get caught, don\u2019t they M\u2019lord Deben?\nAnyway, read and enjoy David Rose\u2019s scoop.

{"headline": "no, climate change is not wiping out the world's insects", "body": "If you believe the Guardian and the BBC, the world is on the brink of Insectapocalypse: A mass extinction of creepy crawlies that threatens the \u201ccollapse of nature.\u201d\nBut if I were you, I\u2019d take these claims with a big pinch of salt, especially if they include the words \u201cclimate change.\u201d That is because the most dramatic, oft-quoted study that links insect loss with climate change turns out to be flawed to the point of uselessness. It is so bad that the Global Warming Policy Foundation has sent a formal complaint to its publishers calling for its withdrawal.\nThe study by Brad Lister and Andres Garcia was published last year by Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS). Titled Climate-driven declines in arthropod abundance restructure a rainforest food web, it appeared to tell a very worrying story about a precipitous decline in the number of insects in Puerto Rico\u2019s Luquillo rainforest.\nAccording to the study\u2019s abstract, climate change is to blame:\nFrom pole to pole, climate warming is disrupting the biosphere at an accelerating pace. Despite generally lower rates of warming in tropical habitats (1), a growing body of theory and data suggests that tropical ectotherms may be particularly vulnerable to climate change.\nClimate change is killing insects in the rainforest because they don\u2019t like it when it gets hotter?? Really???\nStill, somehow it got past the peer review stage and, thence, straight into the pages of the left-wing media, which can\u2019t get enough of these \u201cplanet is dying and it\u2019s all our fault\u201d stories.\n\u201c\u2018Hyperalarming\u2019 study shows massive insect loss,\u201d shrieked the Washington Post.\n\u201cInsects, biodiversity, and mass extinction: an alarming new study,\u201d screeched Vox.\n\u201cInsect collapse: \u2018We are destroying our life support systems,'\u201d sobbed the Guardian.\nNaturally, the study\u2019s co-author Brad Lister had no problems ramping up the apocalyptic significance of his findings. He told the Guardian:\n\u201cWe are essentially destroying the very life support systems that allow us to sustain our existence on the planet, along with all the other life on the planet,\u201d Lister said. \u201cIt is just horrifying to watch us decimate the natural world like this.\u201d\nThe story was eagerly recounted by one of the Guardian\u2018s resident eco-loons, Damian Carrington. Here is the bit that really should have sent Carrington\u2019s alarm bells ringing:\nSince Lister\u2019s first visits to Luquillo, other scientists had predicted that tropical insects, having evolved in a very stable climate, would be much more sensitive to climate warming. \u201cIf you go a little bit past the thermal optimum for tropical insects, their fitness just plummets,\u201d he said. As the data came in, the predictions were confirmed in startling fashion. \u201cThe number of hot spells, temperatures above 29C, have increased tremendously,\u201d he said. \u201cIt went from zero in the 1970s up to something like 44% of the days.\u201d Factors important elsewhere in the world, such as destruction of habitat and pesticide use, could not explain the plummeting insect populations in Luquillo, which has long been a protected area.\nCan environment journalists really be this stupid? When, exactly was this \u201cvery stable climate\u201d in which insects evolved? And if they are really that hypersensitive, how come they survived all the previous periods of warming, such as the Minoan, Roman, and Medieval warming periods?\nAnyway, as you\u2019ll have guessed, the study\u2019s authors had made a major boo-boo. Perhaps they were right about the insect population collapse. But they were completely wrong about it being caused by dramatically rising temperatures. That is because the data sets they used were compromised. The apparent dramatic increase in temperature was the result of a thermometer in the weather station being moved, not of \u201cglobal warming.\u201d\nHad the authors visited the station\u2019s website, they could have found this out for themselves:\nWe all make mistakes. Climate change researchers especially. But despite several articles pointing out the study\u2019s error \u2014 including this by Paul Homewood and this at Watts Up With That? \u2014 the study is still being used as the basis of sundry scaremongering articles in the mainstream media.\nIt is referenced everywhere from this piece in the Guardian to this piece by Tim Stanley in the Telegraph.\nBut the study is bunk.\nThis is the problem with so much of what we\u2019re told about \u201cclimate change.\u201d The mainstream media\u2019s insatiable appetite for global warming scare stories mean that any new study promoting the appropriate doomsday narrative is bigged up by environmental correspondents as yet further evidence that climate change is real. When the papers turn out to be flawed, though, no one is much interested in running the correction.\nAs my old Fleet Street colleagues used to say: \u201cA big lie is halfway round the world before the truth has got his boots on.\u201d\nThis is bad for public understanding of science; bad also for science itself. I am quite prepared to believe that there is a problem with declining insect populations, which we should do our best to address. But if, as in the case of this study, we are being fed the wrong information as to the cause of the loss, how are we supposed to get a proper sense of what needs to be done?"}

They are also passionate about their causes rather than their future careers, unlike most of the cabinet.\nYes. What could be less \u201cslush, drippy, apathetic\u201d and snowflakey, or more \u201cpassionate\u201d about a cause, then going out to a Syrian hellhole, pledging your allegiance to the black flag of ISIS and serially impregnating yourself with the semen of bearded killers rank with the blood of the Yazidis and Shias and Christians they\u2019ve raped, crucified and beheaded?\nOddly, though, the liberal-left has been slow to praise Begum\u2019s commitment and political activism. Instead what progressives everywhere are claiming is that Begum was too young \u2013 at 15: the same age as Greta Thunberg when she started her campaigning \u2013 to know what she was doing when she went out to Syria. That she was just an impressionable innocent who was \u2018radicalised\u2019 by dark outside forces.\nSo, on the one hand, teenagers know what\u2019s best and should be heeded at every turn and promoted in unchallenging interviews on TV.\nAnd on the other, they are sweet innocents who know precisely nothing and should be protected from the consequences of anything they do or so no matter how many people get hurt because, hey, they are only kids.\nThe truth, of course, that kids are merely the useful idiots of the adults pulling their strings.\nIn the case of climate change, for example, children have long been used as pawns to advance the Watermelon (green on the outside, red on the inside) \u201csustainability\u201d agenda.

Under the Conservative government of John Major, the UK signed the Rio treaty, and there was strong endorsement of the sustainability agenda by Environment Secretary John Selwyn Gummer. In the years that followed Agenda 21 made a considerable impact in local authorities.23 The pace of change then accelerated under the Labour government, which in 1998 set up a quango to advise on sustainable education. This move proved significant with the revision of the National Curriculum in 2000, when sustainable development was made a compulsory part of teaching in geography, science, design and technology, and citizenship.\nGosh. Could that by the same John Selwyn Gummer who now goes under the name Lord Deben and whose dodgy dealings and green troughing are now the subject of a parliamentary investigation which the Establishment is busily trying to cover up?\nIt surely could!"}

{"headline": "hurricanes create natural climate change labs in puerto rico", "body": "next Image 1 of 2\nprev Image 2 of 2\nThe hurricanes that pounded Puerto Rico in 2017, blasting away most of its forest cover, may give scientists clues to how the world will respond to climate change and increasingly severe weather.\nResearchers at El Yunque, the only tropical rain forest overseen by the U.S. Forest Service, are running controlled studies on how plants respond to higher temperatures combined \u2014 since the cataclysmic blow from Hurricane Maria \u2014 with severe weather. Not far away, another group is looking at how hurricanes affect the forest environment.\n\"It's a once-in-a-century opportunity to look at these two aspects of climate change together,\" said Tana Wood, a research ecologist with the Forest Service.\nWood heads a team testing how plants themselves respond to higher temperatures. The 2017 hurricane season, with Maria following a lesser blow from Hurricane Irma, has given them a chance as well to see how storms affect the recovery of ecosystems already under stress, a key concern in the Caribbean, where scientists say warmer temperatures could lead to more intense hurricanes.\nOn a recent trek to the site, Wood brushed aside thick branches and leaves the size of laptops as she made her way to three plots surrounded by infrared panels that heat the air and soil by 4 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit). The vegetation there was shorter and a bit browner compared with the three unheated control plots. The warmed plots run on 480 volts of electricity, and while the lines are isolated from the soil, the scientists use insulated boots to avoid getting electrocuted in case of an accident.\nNearby, plant physiologist Rob Tunison clamped what looked like a small compact mirror around a dark green leaf to measure photosynthesis, spending 30 minutes to an hour per leaf.\nWood said they are looking at how temperatures affect basic processes such as photosynthesis \u2014 by which plants transform sunlight into energy while absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing that gas along with oxygen into the atmosphere \u2014 as well as how soils respond.\nThe researchers are also studying nutrients and microbes in the artificially warmed plots of land, keeping sending frozen samples to a lab in California for analysis.\nKnowledge about tropical plants and soils could eventually be plugged into models to determine how vastly broader ecosystems respond to changes.\n\"We are also able to look at the potential for tropical plants and soils to acclimate to consistently warmer conditions over time,\" Wood said.\nTropical forests play a key role in recycling carbon dioxide, and they store about a third of the world's carbon, she said. They also help generate rainfall across the world by releasing water vapor, which in turn creates clouds.\n\"Anything that happens in these systems can have an effect on the world's climate,\" she said.\nU.S., British and international climate agencies reported this month that 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record, and global emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide saw their largest spike in seven years. Overall, global carbon dioxide emissions have increased 55 percent in the past two decades, and Earth has warmed on average about two-thirds of a degree Celsius, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nBritish meteorologists said in early February that the next five years could see record-breaking temperatures. Scientists expect the world this year will spew 40.9 billion tons (37.1 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide, up from 39.8 billion tons (36.2 billion metric tons) last year, according to studies by the Global Carbon Project.\nKim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology who is not involved in the experiments at El Yunque, said she was not aware of any other long-term warming experiments in tropical rainforests.\n\"What will happen at their site is highly uncertain, because the rainforest itself controls so many aspects of the regional water cycle. It's not a system that we can model extremely well today, let alone under climate change scenarios,\" Cobb said. \"But there is little doubt that these kinds of long-term monitoring sites are extremely valuable in advancing our understanding of the water and carbon cycle, and how they might change with climate change.\"\nThe $3 million project, partly funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, is in its fourth year and Wood said she hopes it can run indefinitely. Scientists took a one-year hiatus after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 20, 2017, so they could separate the effect of warming from the effect of the storm, which caused more than $100 billion in damage and toppled trees like dominoes.\nA couple of miles from Woods' experiment, scientists including those from the International Institute of Tropical Forestry are looking at how hurricanes affect the tropical forest. They began by trimming away the canopy leaves above patches of forest to mimic the effects of a storm. They hired arborists to cut tree branches and spread them across the forest floor to study how light and water move through the changed ecosystem and the impact that the debris has on soil microbes. They also monitor cloud base heights to get a sense of how changes could affect rainfall.\nMaria suddenly gave them a real-life test.\n\"It poses a lot of challenges but a lot of opportunities to move the science forward,\" said Grizelle Gonzalez, a project leader.\nThe experiments are expected to continue for several years, barring any interruptions from storms as the Caribbean prepares for another Atlantic hurricane season that starts June 1.\nCobb, the global warming scientist, praised the ongoing experiments.\n\"It is well worth the effort,\" she said. \"The raw beauty of these environments is really only matched by their immense scientific potential.\""}

{"headline": "climate change real because moose ticks, obama warns canada", "body": "President Obama has been in Calgary, Canada, warning his audience of the perils of man-made climate change.\nApparently, it is even affecting their national mammal.\nThe Hill reports:\n\u201cAll of us are going to have to recognize that there are trade-offs involved with how we live, how our economy is structured, and the world that we\u2019re going to be passing on to our kids and grandkids. Nobody is exempt from that conversation,\u201d Obama said. He also noted that rising oceans risk coastal populations and environmental changes have boosted the frequency of insect-borne diseases. \u201cMoose right now [have] to deal with tick-borne diseases that they didn\u2019t have to do 10, 15 years ago. I really like moose. I assume, Canadians, you do too,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThese are just facts.\u201d\nJust facts. Really?\nAnyone who believes the nonsense that the frequency of insect-borne diseases has increased as a result of climate change really needs to read this damning assessment by Prof Paul Reiter.\nIt dates back to 2005 but little has changed since. Reiter is an expert on vector-borne diseases \u2013 especially malaria \u2013 and former contributing author of the 1996 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for the chapter on the impact of global warming on human health.\nReiter\u2019s basic point is very simple: historically insect diseases have thrived in many places where it is not warm, including England which used to be rife with malaria. So it makes no sense to attribute them to global warming.\nReiter was appalled to find that none of his fellow IPCC \u2018contributing authors\u2019 had any expertise in the field. As Christopher Booker describes in his book The Real Global Warming Disaster, one was an expert on the effectiveness of motor cycle helmets; two were full time environmental activists who had written articles on subjects from mercury poisoning to land mines.\nBut it soon became clear to Reiter that regardless of the facts on vector-borne diseases, the IPCC was determined to finger climate change in a way that was \u2018ill-informed, biased, and scientifically unacceptable.\u2019\nAs Reiter told a Parliamentary Select Committee on Economic Affairs hearing in London:\nIn the age of information, popular knowledge of scientific issues\u2014particularly issues of health and the environment\u2014is awash in a tide of misinformation, much of it presented in the \u201cbig talk\u201d of professional scientists. Alarmist activists operating in well-funded advocacy groups have a lead role in creating this misinformation. In many cases, they manipulate public perceptions with emotive and fiercely judgmental \u201cscientific\u201d pronouncements, adding a tone of danger and urgency to attract media coverage. Their skill in promoting notions of scientific \u201cfact\u201d sidesteps the complexities of the issues involved, and is a potent influence in education, public opinion and the political process. These notions are often re-enforced by attention to peer-reviewed scientific articles that appear to support their pronouncements, regardless of whether these articles are widely endorsed by the relevant scientific community. Scientists who challenge these alarmists are rarely given priority by the media, and are often presented as \u201cskeptics\u201d.\nYet here is Obama reviving the old \u201cfrequency of insect-borne diseases\u201d lie, which was untrue in 1996, remained untrue in 2005 and which is still untrue today.\nSame goes for his other claim.\nThe rising oceans one has been frequently debunked, most recently by Judith Curry, former Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology.\nMean global sea level has risen at a slow creep for more than 150 years; since 1900, global mean sea level has risen about 7-8 inches. The implications of the highest values of projected sea-level rise under future climate change scenarios are profound, with far reaching socioeconomic and environmental implications. However, these projections are regarded as deeply uncertain and the highest of these projections strain credulity.\nAs for his insistence that \u201cnobody is exempt from this conversation\u201d. How come it doesn\u2019t seem to apply to Barack Obama?"}

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal would require Americans to rely on unreliable solar and wind energy that would raise electric bills by several hundred percent for every family and business, hit us with power blackouts and brownouts, worsen poverty and do nothing to slow climate change.\nYes, you read that right. Even the drastic, unrealistic and multitrillion-dollar energy schemes in the Green New Deal would have no measureable impact on global temperatures in our lives or our grandchildren\u2019s lifetimes.\nOcasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., knows little if anything about climate science.

The \u201ccure\u201d is far more harmful than the problem it is designed to solve.\nJUSTIN HASKINS: GREEN NEW DEAL WOULD DESTROY AMERICAN DREAM, CREATE AMERICAN NIGHTMARE\nNine of the 10 desired outcomes of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal mention environmental issues, with a particular emphasis on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from our use of fossil fuels. The goal is 100 percent reliance on renewable energy in 10 years.\nThis sounds attractive. But there are physical, practical and economic limits to our embrace of renewable energy sources.\nEnergy is required for everything humans do, and the more expensive it is, the more poverty will be exacerbated.\nOcasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., knows little if anything about climate science. She has come up with a plan that is the equivalent of amputating your leg to deal with an ingrown toenail. The \u201ccure\u201d is far more harmful than the problem it is designed to solve.\nWhether we like it or not, the world runs mostly on fossil fuels, which have the advantage of very large energy density and availability, day or night, even when the sun doesn\u2019t shine and the wind doesn\u2019t blow.\nSolar and wind energy are not free. They are only practical in limited regions, and they require huge diversions of funds to produce relatively small amounts of energy per acre of land and physical resources used.\nThe intermittency of solar and wind energy causes instability and inefficiencies in the electric grid. Across European countries, the cost of electricity doubles for only a 25 percent reliance on wind and solar power.\nAnd, of course, air travel will likely always be dependent on fossil fuels due to their light weight and high energy density. You don\u2019t want the plane you are riding in to lose power when the sun goes down or on a cloudy day.\nIt\u2019s legitimate to ask just how much future climate change would be averted if (for example) the world fully embraced the Paris Climate Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The answer is a virtually unmeasurable amount: global warming would be reduced by 0.17 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, even if the agreement\u2019s 2030 goal is extended for another 70 years.\nAnd that assumes computer projections of future warming are reliable. One 2018 study of ocean and atmospheric warming since the late 1800s found that climate models are overestimating global warming from increasing greenhouse gases by about a factor of two.\nAnd even that study assumed that 100 percent of the warming is humanity\u2019s fault. The alarmist U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change admits that the fraction of global warming caused by humans might not be much more than one-half, further reducing the threat of warming.\nAnd the Green New Deal calls for far greater changes than the Paris Climate Agreement does.\nJames Hansen, the modern godfather of global warming theory, has admitted that only a widespread embrace of nuclear power can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the Green New Deal would eliminate nuclear power.\nAll this points to simple fact: for now, fossil fuels are the moral choice. Mandated reliance on expensive solar and wind energy in the U.S. would make our lives much harder and would make energy much more expensive, hurting poor people the most. And there would be no measureable impact on global temperatures in our, or our grandchildren\u2019s, lifetimes.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nNo one can say what the future will bring. Perhaps many years from now there will be monumental advances in solar and wind power and batteries to store such power, making it possible to rely on renewable energy for all our power needs.\nBut this isn\u2019t not going to happen in time to meet the 10-year deadline the Green New Deal sets for complete reliance on renewable energy. Simply wishing for or mandating scientific advances will not make them take place."}

It has been, in fact, a recurring theme since the beginning of his pontificate in 2013 and he is the only pope in history to write an encyclical letter on the environment.\nTwo years ago, Francis addressed the international summit \u201cWater and Climate: Meeting of the Great Rivers of the World,\u201d sponsored by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in which he expressed his concern for water conservation around the world, as well as his fervent desire that \u201cthe threat posed by climate change to our brothers and sisters in the most vulnerable countries will find prompt and effective responses.\u201d\nLast fall, the pontiff called the lack of safe drinking water in the world an \u201cimmense shame,\u201d adding that better access to drinking water must be provided to people around the globe.\nPeople dying from the lack of clean water \u201cis an immense shame for humanity in the 21st century,\u201d he said, yet \u201cunfortunately, in many of the countries where the population does not have regular access to drinking water, there is no shortage of arms and ammunition, which continues to worsen the situation.\u201d\nThe pope\u2019s frequent comments on the topic of water have even led to criticism from with his own Jesuit order, with warnings that he risks making the Church sound like just one more social justice NGO with no unique message for humanity.\nIn a powerful essay last October, Jesuit Father James V. Schall suggested that Pope Francis has invested much time and effort into political and secular topics such as climate change and immigration while seemingly downplaying key issues of Catholic moral teaching.\nFather Schall, a prominent intellectual who taught political science at Georgetown University for many years, took issue specifically with the pope\u2019s Letter on the World\u2019s Day of Prayer for Creation, which focused on access \u201cto clean water,\u201d a topic that would seem to fall outside the specific mission of the Catholic Church.\n\u201cChrist walked on water, turned water into wine, helped a woman at a well draw it up, and was baptized with it in the Jordan,\u201d Schall noted. \u201cHe never designed a dam to provide water for Nazareth or Jerusalem. He evidently assumed that men could eventually figure this task out without the need of revelation.\u201d\n\u201cA pope can mention the problem of water availability or other such issues, but his is not the task to provide technical solutions even if he had a doctorate in water engineering,\u201d he added.\nMore importantly, many people of good \u201cwill wonder why, if the pope can talk of clean water, he cannot talk about his own record or what he holds on issues that certainly do fall within his competency.

{"headline": "ancient garbage heaps show fading byzantine empire was 'plagued' by disease and climate change", "body": "About a century before the fall of the Byzantine Empire \u2014 the eastern portion of the vast Roman Empire \u2014 signs of its impending doom were written in garbage.\nArchaeologists recently investigated accumulated refuse in trash mounds at a Byzantine settlement called Elusa in Israel's Negev Desert . They found that the age of the trash introduced an intriguing new timeline for the Byzantine decline, scientists reported in a new study. [The Holy Land: 7 Amazing Archaeological Finds]\nThe researchers discovered that trash disposal \u2014 once a well-organized and reliable service in outpost cities like Elusa \u2014 ceased around the middle of the sixth century, about 100 years prior to the empire's collapse. At that time, a climate event known as the Late Antique Little Ice Age was taking hold in the Northern Hemisphere, and an epidemic known as the Justinian plague raged through the Roman Empire, eventually killing over 100 million people .\nTogether, disease and climate change took a devastating economic toll and loosened Rome's grip on its lands to the east a century earlier than once thought, according to the study.\nFinding treasure in trash\nElusa was already partly excavated, but the new investigation was the first to explore the site's long-ignored trash heaps, lead study author Guy Bar-Oz, a professor of archaeology at the University of Haifa in Israel, told Live Science in an email.\nUnlike the architecture of an ancient city, which could be repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt, landfills steadily accumulated over time, creating continuous records of human activity. Clues found in preserved garbage dumps could thereby reveal if a city was thriving or in trouble.\n\"For me, it was clear that the true gold mine of data about daily life and what urban existence in the past really looked like was in the garbage,\" Bar-Oz said.\nIn the dump sites, the scientists found a variety of objects: ceramic pot sherds, seeds, olive pits, charcoal from burned wood and even evidence of discarded \"gourmet foods\" imported from the Red Sea and the Nile, the study authors reported.\nThe scientists carbon-dated organic material such as seeds and charcoal in layers of trash mounds located near the city. They found that trash had built up in that location over a period of about 150 years and that the accumulation terminated in the middle of the sixth century. This suggested there was a failure of infrastructure, which happens when a city is about to collapse, the researchers noted.\nBased on the new evidence, researchers concluded that Elusa's decline began at least a century before Islamic rule wrested control of the region from the Romans. In fact, Elusa was struggling during a period that was relatively peaceful and stable; it was during this time that the Roman Emperor Justinian was expanding the empire's boundaries across Europe, Africa and Asia, Bar-Oz said.\nWith the empire enjoying \"a period of glorious success,\" it would seem logical to expect that its outposts would be financially secure, Bar-Oz said. Yet the data the researchers collected suggested the opposite.\n\"Instead, we are seeing a signal for what was really going on at that time and which has long been nearly invisible to most archaeologists \u2014 that the empire was being plagued by climatic disaster and disease,\" Bar-Oz explained.\nThe findings were published online today (March 25) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nOriginally published on Live Science."}
{"headline": "mozambique city battled climate change, then came a cyclone", "body": "Long before Cyclone Idai roared in and tore apart Mozambique's seaside city of Beira, the mayor dreamed of protecting his people from climate change.\nIt would be a huge challenge. Large parts of the city of 500,000 residents are below sea level on a coastline that experts warn is one of the world's most vulnerable to global warming's rising waters.\nWith the World Bank's support, a $120 million project was approved in 2012 to help spare the city's fading Art Deco center and makeshift slums from rising waters. An 11-kilometer (seven-mile) system of drainage canals and water retention basins now snakes from the beach deep into boggy neighborhoods.\nIt meant \"the end of suffering of a whole population,\" Mayor Daviz Simango declared as the project's first phase was completed last year.\nBut the cyclone that struck on March 14 brought a whole new level of pain to Beira, with images of destruction to chill any seaside nation already fearing for its survival.\n\"We were really well prepared for disasters like flooding,\" Simango told The Associated Press, pausing from his work directing the disaster response in one of the city's poorest neighborhoods, Munhava.\nThe new system worked perfectly when there was flooding two months ago, said the mayor, a civil engineer who at times personally oversaw its construction. Residents told him they no longer needed to sleep on their tables.\nThen \"God changed his plan and brought a cyclone,\" Simango said. Packing winds of some 240 kilometers (150 miles) an hour, the storm ripped apart structures built to withstand less than half that intensity. \"This cyclone destroyed everything we built for more than 100 years.\"\nIt was painful watching the cyclone veer toward Beira, said World Bank staffers involved in the project who kept in touch with people on the ground until the storm severed power and communications.\nWith Idai, \"suddenly we have a cyclone category 4 hitting, and it's very vulnerable,\" Michel Matera, a senior urban specialist with the World Bank, told the AP. \"Yes, we were doing the right thing but it was not enough.\"\nLong and narrow with a 2,400-kilometer (1,500-mile) Indian Ocean coastline, Mozambique is on the frontline of fighting climate change in Africa, where most nations have little infrastructure and funding to cope. Rapidly growing coastal cities like Beira are especially at risk.\nThe mayor called it unjust that African nations face some of the toughest challenges while contributing little to global warming. People in rich, industrialized nations produce much of the carbon dioxide and other gases that are warming the planet by burning the most coal, diesel, gasoline and jet fuel.\nBut while Simango believes the international community should help African nations, he stressed the continent's leaders must do their part to fight graft and not pocket the aid.\n\"Sometimes we get money, resources but the corruption kills us,\" he said. \"We must be more prepared as leaders, doing our best to use every cent to save lives.\"\nOrdinary Mozambicans may not be familiar with the science behind climate change. But the Beira residents who pick their way through inundated streets, and the longtime fishermen who keenly watch the sea and sky, have noticed changes.\nThey note that local temperatures that once topped out at around 34 degrees Celsius (93 degrees Fahrenheit) now reach a sweltering 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). That warming air can hold more moisture, experts say, meaning the potential for heavier rains .\nFor fisherman Nueve Savimbi, who stood with a bamboo fishing pole where Beira's new concrete drainage system meets the sea, it took the raging storm to open his eyes.\n\"I've heard about climate change but didn't believe it until I saw the cyclone,\" he said. \"Without this (drainage system), there would be flooding here. But there is still work to do. Channels like this should be built elsewhere.\"\nWithout extensive study, scientists cannot directly link a single weather event like Cyclone Idai to the changing climate, but global warming is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme weather events, as well as droughts, floods and fires.\nMozambique ranks third among African nations in vulnerability to weather-related disasters, behind Somalia and Madagascar, and studies say climate change will make those threats more intense and unpredictable , according to the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, a World Bank-managed grant-funding partnership.\nFor residents recovering from the cyclone and those watching with alarm from afar \u2014 the storm hit as Africa Climate week unfolded across the continent in Ghana, another vulnerable coastal nation \u2014 the time has come to treat climate change as an emergency.\n\"Cyclone Idai was an uncommonly fierce and prolonged storm, yet another alarm bell about the dangers of climate change, especially in vulnerable, at-risk countries,\" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday. \"Such events are becoming more frequent, more severe and devastating and more widespread, and this will only get worse if we do not act now.\"\nThe world must deliver on the $100 billion pledged as part of the Paris climate agreement to help Mozambique and other developing nations build climate resilience, Guterres said. Countries around the world, rich and poor, had more than $2.2 trillion in economic losses from climate-related disasters between 1998 and 2017, the U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction said in October.\nIn Beira, it is too early to calculate the cyclone's toll, whether in economic losses or even in lives.\nSome residents say they believe an exodus will begin, with people leaving the port city for higher, safer places. Others argue that eventually, there will be nowhere else to go.\n\"Other districts have flooding,\" said Julia Castigo, who stood on the beach watching survivors arrive by boat from the badly hit district of Buzi. \"The flooding will find us.\"\nAnother onlooker, Paolo Fernando Machata said a major flood nearly two decades ago didn't reach his village, but this one swallowed it. He spent three days stranded in flood waters, he said, pointing to his bandaged, swollen feet.\n\"I'd never heard about climate change,\" he said. \"What I know is, things are changing. If cyclones like this keep happening, we will lose this town and the people in it, and our society.\"\nStill, that society has already shown flashes of resilience amid the destruction. Beira's seaside bars have reopened, pulsing with generator-powered music. Muddy markets bustle again, and shop owners have cleared away broken glass and reopened. Some classes have resumed as children in bright uniforms now share school buildings with displaced people.\nFrom the international relief operations base at Beira's airport, Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, deputy director of the United Nations humanitarian operation, was frank. \"I think the world realizes we haven't done enough about climate change,\" he told journalists. Disasters \"are getting worse around the world. All of us must be prepared.\"\nFor Beira's mayor, the time to take climate change seriously has come. Standing in a still-sodden neighborhood, he urged U.S. President Donald Trump to come to Mozambique and see for himself.\n\"I think he is living in another world,\" Simango said of Trump's expressions of doubt about global warming. \"I've seen by my own eyes the rising of the sea level. I've seen by my own eyes people suffering. I've seen flooding. Climate change is a reality. Climate change is bringing us trouble.\"\n___\nFollow Africa news at https://twitter.com/AP_Africa"}

Much of what is being proposed in the Green New Deal should not only cause skepticism, but should be considered draconian and even geopolitically dangerous.\nThe migration towards cleaner, alternative energy needs to be done in a methodical, sustainable and intelligent way, otherwise, the consequences could be far worse than anyone can imagine.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nPerhaps we should pause and consider why none of the global warming models from two decades ago have come to fruition. Perhaps we should slow down and think about the consequences of allowing our adversaries to supply the world with cheap energy, because one thing is for sure \u2013 wind farms and solar panels won't get the job done.\nThe objective reader should examine all sides of the climate debate and should ask himself: Are the consequences of acting hastily worse than not acting at all?

{"headline": "climate change drove some neanderthals to cannibalism", "body": "Six Neanderthals who lived in what is now France were eaten by their fellow Neanderthals some 100,000 years ago, according to gruesome evidence of the cannibalistic event discovered by scientists in a cave in the 1990s.\nNow, researchers may have figured out why the Neanderthals, including two children, became victims of cannibalism: global warming.\nWhile prior studies have interpreted Neanderthal remains to find proof of cannibalistic behavior, this is the first study to offer clues as to what may have led Neanderthals to become cannibals. Scientists found that rapid shifts in local ecosystems as the planet warmed may have extinguished the animal species that Neanderthals ate, forcing them to look elsewhere to fill their bellies. [25 Grisly Archaeological Discoveries]\nThe researchers examined a layer of sediment in a cave known as Baume Moula-Guercy, in southeastern France. There, excavations in 1999 by another team of scientists had uncovered 120 Neanderthal bones from six individuals that showed signs of being cannibalized.\nLater, in 2014, another group of researchers analyzed the cave deposits to a depth of 26 feet (8 meters), dividing them into 19 layers associated with three climate shifts. For the new study, the authors turned their attention to layer 15, a silty sediment layer about 16 inches (40 centimeters) thick, covering approximately 98 to 131 feet (30 to 40 m) of the cave floor.\nIn that layer, charcoal and animal bones were so well-preserved that scientists could reconstruct an environmental snapshot representing 120,000 to 130,000 years ago. They discovered that the climate in the area was likely even warmer than it is today, and that the transition from a cold, arid climate to a warmer one happened quickly, \"maybe within a few generations,\" study co-author Emmanuel Desclaux, a research associate at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis in France, told Cosmos magazine.\nAs the animals that once populated the landscape vanished, some Neanderthals ate what they could find \u2014 their neighbors.\nCannibalism is by no means exclusive to Neanderthals, and has been practiced by humans and their relatives \"from the early Palaeolithic to the Bronze Age and beyond,\" the study authors reported. The behavior adopted by the starving Neanderthals in the Baume Moula-Guercy should therefore not be viewed as \"a mark of bestiality or sub-humanity,\" but as an emergency adaptation to a period of severe environmental stress, according to the study.\nThe findings were published online in the April issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science.\nOriginally published on Live Science."}

Now. pic.twitter.com/M3BM11wA1d \u2014 Barbara Lee (@BLeeForCongress) April 5, 2019\nThe two women and many other climate change believers are referring to a United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released last year, according the Guardian:\nThe world\u2019s leading climate scientists have warned there is only a dozen years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. The authors of the landmark report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released on Monday say urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to reach the target, which they say is affordable and feasible although it lies at the most ambitious end of the Paris agreement pledge to keep temperatures between 1.5C and 2C. The half-degree difference could also prevent corals from being completely eradicated and ease pressure on the Arctic, according to the 1.5C study, which was launched after approval at a final plenary of all 195 countries in Incheon in South Korea that saw delegates hugging one another, with some in tears.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a line in the sand and what it says to our species is that this is the moment and we must act now,\u201d Debra Roberts, a co-chair of the working group on impacts, said in the Guardian report. \u201cThis is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilizes people and dents the mood of complacency.\u201d\nNot everyone \u2014 including many scientists \u2014 believe in the climate change expiration date.\nIn November 2018 more than a dozen prominent scientists met in Germany to cast doubt on the U.N.\u2019s claim about man-made climate change and its consequences.\nThe scientists spoke at the 12th International Climate and Energy Conference, cosponsored by the free-market think tank, the Heartland Institute:\nAmong the highlights of the EIKE conference, scientists will discuss the latest science regarding natural climate cycles, sea level, solar variability versus atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, shortcomings regarding renewable power, flaws in asserted temperature histories, the benefits of a warmer world, desertification, and ulterior goals of climate activists.\n\u201cThe scientific evidence and conclusions reported by climate scientists are far different than what the environmental left and their legacy media allies would like the public to believe,\u201d Heartland Institute Senior Fellow James Taylor said.\nRonald Bailey, a science correspondent with Reason magazine who believes in man-made climate change but not the U.N. report, wrote:\nThere is no denying that man-made global warming could become a significant problem for humanity over the course of this century. In addition, the projections of the climate and econometric models could be way underestimated. Consequently, hedge fund manager Bob Litterman sensibly argues that climate change is an undiversifiable risk that would command a higher risk premium. Litterman likens climate change risk to the systemic risk that investors face in the stock market. It is hard to hedge when unknown unknowns can cause the prices of all assets to decline at once. While Litterman\u2019s analysis strongly suggests that some investments toward mitigating climate risk should be made, it is not unreasonable to question the expensive and rushed decarbonization schemes proposed in the IPCC report.\n\u201cIn any case, if the worst-case projections of the IPCC report are even approximately correct, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is wrong\u2014our kids will not be doomed in 12 years, or even in 81, \u201d Bailey concluded.\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter"}

Now by my math, the chance of that happening is about 125,000 to one,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur economy is on the line, our future is on the line, lives are on the line,\u201d Buttigieg concluded.\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s call this what it is: climate security a life and death issue for our generation,\u201d said the openly gay millennial and second-term mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\nCuriously, despite Mayor Pete\u2019s attempts to link climate change to increasingly bad weather, 2018 was the first year on record with no violent tornadoes in the United States, according to a report by the Washington Post.\nAccording to Post weather writer Ian Livingston, while record-breaking, 2018 was not altogether exceptional, since \u201cthere have been downtrends in violent tornado numbers both across the entire modern period, and when looking at just the period since Doppler radar was fully implemented across the country in the mid-1990s.\u201d\nAs the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has noted, many recent climatological events and trends \u201ccan be explained by the natural variability of the climate system,\u201d without excluding an indeterminate influence from atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. In the same report, the WMO said that researchers have not yet been able to ascertain \u201cthe respective roles being played by climate variability and human-induced climate change.\u201d\nMoreover, many climate scientists acknowledge the practical impossibility of correlating specific meteorological events to \u201cglobal warming.\u201d\nAs Nature magazine explained in 2012, \u201cclimate attribution\u201d \u2014 the attempt to link singular weather events to manmade global warming \u2014 \u201crests on a comparison of the probability of an observed weather event in the real world with that of the \u2018same\u2019 event in a hypothetical world without global warming.\u201d\nAs critics have observed, such attribution claims \u201care unjustifiably speculative, basically unverifiable and better not made at all.\u201d\nFollow Thomas D.

Fortunately, Christians have a great resource to help them through such times: the Bible. In First Thessalonians 4:13-4, the Apostle Paul addresses the problem of grief; he offers comfort to the assembled believers, reminding them that the faithful who sleep in death will awake in life, basking forever in the glowing presence of God:\nWe want you to be quite certain, brothers, about those who have fallen asleep, to make sure that you do not grieve for them, as others do who have no hope. We believe that Jesus died and rose again, and that in the same way God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.\nTo some, these words will be no comfort. To others, they will mean great comfort\u2014that\u2019s the gift of faith.\nOr, one should say, that\u2019s the gift of the Christian faith, and of all other faiths that offer the promise of a transcendent destiny for each human soul.\nThere are, of course, other kinds of faith. For instance, there are the Greens, and what they believe. All over the world\u2014albeit mostly in the Western Europe and North America\u2014the Greens proclaim their credo: The end is near. As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said on January 22, \u201cThe world is going to end in 12 years if we don\u2019t address climate change.\u201d So there we have it: a profession of faith.\nInterestingly, even as the bombs were going off in Sri Lanka, protesters in London, spearheaded by the actress Emma Thompson, were staging an \u201cextinction rebellion.\u201d That is, they were rebelling against the supposed deadly threat of climate change, as opposed to the more obvious deadly threat of terrorism.\nHappily, nobody\u2019s life was extinguished at that Green protest, perhaps because the London police were on hand, protecting protesters and bystanders alike.\nSpeaking of the police, we should observe that in terrible moments, it\u2019s usually the first responders who show the most courage; that is, they are the ones who go running toward the trouble, when the normal human instinct is to go running away.\nAnd because all cultures admire courage and sacrifice, it\u2019s little wonder that these first responders around the world tend to emerge as popular icons, as trusted bulwarks of public safety. That is, so long as a society needs protection from the forces of chaos\u2014be they terroristic, or merely criminal\u2014the men and women who embody that protection will be regarded as heroes, as role models, and even, sometimes, as political leaders. After all, the words \u201claw and order\u201d translate easily into any language.\nSo yes, we must grieve for those who were killed in Sri Lanka\u2014and be duly reminded that the threat of terror is, in the most literal sense, omnipresent.\nYet even in terrible times, those who put their faith in God have a kind of armor. Moreover, those who put another kind of faith in law and order have a second kind of armor.\nTo be doubly armored is a good thing.

Because I know what happened in the past, not only is my forecasting improved, but it also helps me to cast a skeptical eye at some of the hype being raised over man-made climate change.\nWhen it comes to hurricanes, I think the hysteria relies in large part on the fact that most people do not know 20th century hurricane history.

The letter can be read here.\nAccording to the GPWF, the programme \u201cwent far beyond its remit to present the facts about climate change, instead broadcasting a highly politicised manifesto in favour of renewable energy and unjustified alarm.\u201d\nThe GWPF says:\nThe programme highlighted suggestions that storms, floods, heatwaves and sea level rise are all rapidly getting worse as a result of climate change. However, the best available data, published in the last few years by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and NASA, contradicts the BBC\u2019s alarmist exaggeration of empirical evidence. In its 5th Assessment Report (2013), the IPCC concluded: \u201cCurrent datasets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century \u2026 No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin.\u201d In its more recent Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C, published in 2018, these findings were reconfirmed. It stated that \u201cNumerous studies towards and beyond AR5 have reported a decreasing trend in the global number of tropical cyclones and/or the globally accumulated cyclonic energy\u2026 There is consequently low confidence in the larger number of studies reporting increasing trends in the global number of very intense cyclones.\u201d Regarding floods, the IPCC\u2019s Special Report concluded: \u201cThere is low confidence due to limited evidence, however, that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and the magnitude of floods. \u201c There is also no observational evidence that the rate of sea level rise is getting worse. NASA satellite data shows that since 1993, there has been an annual mean sea level rise of 3.3mm, with no significant level of acceleration in the last three decades. Suggestions by David Attenborough and Michael Mann that climate change is causing increases in wildfires in the US and globally are also misleading and not supported by any empirical evidence. According to a survey published by the Royal Society the global area burned has actually declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago.

Attenborough claimed on the voiceover that this had been caused by \u201cclimate change\u201d and the melting of the sea ice on which the walruses hunted for food. But evidence has since emerged that it wasn\u2019t climate change which killed the walruses but rather a combination of marauding polar bears and the Netflix film crew whose activities may have scared the tusked, bewhiskered creatures to their doom."}

And despite a trend toward a hotter and drier climate, an unseasonably chilly April and high humidity damaged crops on the farmlands around Baghdad.\nPrime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi called it imperative to revamp infrastructure and water policies to prepare for more extreme weather events, though the rains this year pose a policy dilemma as unpredictable climate stresses may lead to both droughts and floods.\n\"This will be a very important lesson for us in the next year, and the coming years,\" Abdul-Mahdi told a press conference in April\nOutside the town of Buhriz in eastern Diyala province, where Sirwan River flows into Iraq from neighboring Iran, Nouri Kudaier waded through his waterlogged citrus grove to see what he could salvage of this season's harvest.\n\"We're asking for compensation from the government for the damage,\" Kudaier said. \"It's our only source of livelihood.\"\nIraq has not seen as much precipitation in a single winter since 1988, according to the Ministry of Water Resources, which reported 47 billion cubic meters of water in the country's reservoirs. That's three times what was there at the same time last year, when water levels were so dire that the government banned farmers from growing seasonal crops during the summer months.\nIn Youssifiyah, a farming region just south of Baghdad, canals that were empty last year are flush with water, and wells that were dug 24 meters (79 feet) deep now come up with water at a depth of just 6 meters (20 feet).\nSalah al-Saidey said he planted twice as much wheat this year but the heavy rains and cold ruined a portion of his cucumber and tomato crop.\n\"We have a fungus growing,\" said al-Saidey, pointing to the brittle, yellow leaves on the vines. \"We weren't expecting it. We're trying to fight it, but we can't keep pace.\"\nSpring floods used to be common in Iraq. For millennia, farmers relied on the floods to inundate their fields and grow rice, wheat and other grains.\nBut the floods were unpredictable, and every so often the rivers would burst their banks in Baghdad and elsewhere, with calamitous results.\nModernization projects in the 20th century saw Iraq build dams along the Tigris and its tributaries, and canals to divert water. Upstream, Turkey, Iran and Syria did the same, and the inundations became a distant memory, especially as rising temperatures brought weaker rains and faster evaporation from lakes and reservoirs.\nLast year, desperate shortages of clean water led residents to riot in Basra, Iraq's main oil hub and its largest city in the south. The flow of the Euphrates and Tigris grew so weak that creeping seawater from the Persian Gulf reached the Chibayish freshwater marshes about 180 kilometers (112 miles) upstream, contaminating them with salt.\nThis year, that won't be a problem, said the head of Basra's provincial council \u2014 the revived rivers flushed the salt away and filled the marshes with fresh water.\n\"We have enough water for this year and one after, God willing\" said Sabah al-Bazouni.\nBut securing water for future generations will depend on more than favorable weather, says Iraq's water resources minister, Jamal al-Adily.\nIt will require a collaborative effort between Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran, he said. Some 70% of Iraq's water flows from the three upstream countries, though no formal water sharing agreement exists between them.\n\"Iraqis have a right to water,\" al-Adily told The Associated Press. \"The rivers were here before the borders.\"\nWith reservoirs flush with water, there may be no better time to start discussions in earnest.\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said his country would soon send a special representative of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Baghdad to discuss water administration.\nAnd as Iraq simultaneously plans to expand its own oil production, it has a vital resource to leverage in water negotiations. Turkey is expected to rebalance its oil supplies after the U.S. announced it was ending the waivers that have allowed Turkey to import oil from Iran despite sanctions imposed by Washington.\nIraq is one of Turkey's leading suppliers of crude oil, and the two countries already make approximately $10 billion in bilateral trade.\n\"Water should be a link to open trade between the two countries,\" said al-Adily. \"Turkey will stand to benefit from cooperating with Iraq.\"\n___\nAssociated Press writer Nabil al-Jurani in Basra, Iraq, contributed to this report.\nFollow Issa at www.twitter.com/philiptissa"}

Instead, he said there would be statements from ministers and Finland which currently holds the chair of the Arctic Council.\nOfficial U.S. statements and documents prepared for the meeting did not refer to \"climate change\" and their scientific focus was limited to reductions in U.S. carbon emissions that predate the administration and research.\nIn a roughly 20-minute speech outlining the Trump administration's Arctic policy on Monday, Pompeo acknowledged melting ice but didn't use the phrase \"climate change.\" In fact, his address was largely an admonition against increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic. Nor did he indicate that the administration places any priority on easing the melting that scientists say is already causing oceans to rise.\n\"Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new naval passageways and new opportunities for trade, potentially slashing the time it takes for ships to travel between Asia and the West by 20 days,\" he said in the speech, which was met with polite but muted applause.\n\"Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st century's Suez and Panama Canals.\"\nAsked directly about climate change and the Arctic in an interview with a Finnish newspaper, Pompeo declined the opportunity to mention the phrase and downplayed the importance of the Paris climate accord from which President Donald Trump.\n\"My view on this and President Trump's view on this is what we should put all our emphasis on I outcomes,\" he said. \"We can call it whatever we like, but I shared some of the data in the speech. The United States is kicking it when it comes to getting its CO2 down. I mean, compare it to China, compare it to Russia, compare it, frankly, to many European nations, each of whom signed the Paris agreement.\"\nAccording to the statistics he presented, U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions fell by 14% between 2005 and 2017, while global energy-related CO2 emissions increased more than 20%. In terms of black carbon, which is a particular threat to the Arctic, U.S. emissions were 16% below 2013 levels in 2016 and are projected to nearly halve by 2025, he said.\n\"I'm sure it was a good party,\" Pompeo said of the negotiations in Paris. \"I'm sure it felt good to sign the agreement. But at the end of the day, what matters to human health, what matters to the citizens of the world, is that we actually have an impact on improving health. And our technology, our innovation, the R&D we put in in the United States, that's what will drive better climatic outcomes, that's what will create cleaner air and safer drinking water, and that's what I hope the whole world will focus on.\"\nPompeo again declined the opportunity to mention \"climate change\" on Tuesday when he met with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland who pointedly referred to the phenomenon as she played down a dispute with the United States over the sovereignty of the Northwest Passage.\n\"We have a very close, very fruitful collaboration,\" she said. \"And actually, as we see the conditions of the Northwest Passage changing with our changing climate, I think that's actually grounds for closer collaboration with the United States.\"\nPompeo replied by saying the U.S. is more concerned about Russia and China in the Arctic than ownership of the Northwest Passage.\n\"The challenges in the Arctic aren't between the United States and Canada, let me assure you,\" he said. \"There are others that threaten to use it in ways that are not consistent with the rule of law.\""}

(Clonal trees, which are vast colonies of genetically identical plants that grow from a single ancestor, can live for tens of thousands of years.)\nHow old is 2,624 years, really? To borrow an analogy from the Charlotte Observer, that age makes this tree older than Christianity, the Roman Empire and the English language.\nResearchers discovered the ancient cypress while studying tree rings in an effort to piece together the climate history of the eastern United States. (In addition to marking a tree's age, the width and color of tree rings indicate how wet or dry a given year was ). Because of previous fieldwork, the team knew that a particular stand of bald cypress trees in the Black River's Three Sisters Swamp was one of the oldest tree clusters in the country. That earlier research identified several trees between 1,000 and 1,650 years old. [Bristlecone Pines: Photos Reveal Some of Earth's Oldest Organisms]\nThe new study reveals that bald cypresses have even greater longevity than researchers previously thought. In addition to the 2,624-year-old individual reported above, the researchers found a 2,088-year-old cypress in the same swamp \u2014 and there are likely more where that came from.\n\"Because we have cored and dated only 110 living bald cypress at this site, a small fraction of the tens of thousands of trees still present in these wetlands, there could be several additional individual bald cypress over 2,000-years old along the approximately 100 km (62 mile) reach of Black River,\" the researchers wrote in the study.\nAccording to the new study, bald cypress trees are now confirmed to be the oldest known wetland tree species on Earth. This discovery also makes the bald cypress the fifth-oldest species of non-clonal tree on Earth; only individual Sierra juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) trees, giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum), alerces (Fitzroya cupressoides) and Great Basin bristlecone pines (Pinus longaeva) have been found to be older. The world's oldest bristlecone pine, located in the White Mountains of California, is 5,066 years old \u2014 roughly twice the age of the newfound cypress. The oldest clonal tree is thought to stand in the grove of quaking aspen trees known as Pando, in Utah.\nAlthough the ancient trees described in this study live on protected land that is privately owned by The Nature Conservancy\u2019s North Carolina chapter, their existence remains threatened by ongoing logging and biomass farming operations (e.g., chopping down trees for mulch) elsewhere on the river, as well as by industrial pollution and climate change.\n\"The discovery of the oldest known living trees in eastern North America, which are in fact some of the oldest living trees on earth, provides powerful incentive for private, state, and federal conservation of this remarkable waterway,\" the authors concluded.\nOriginally published on Live Science."}

The real key is access to reliable, affordable, and abundant energy.\nWithout electricity, daily tasks necessary for living such as cooking, gathering water, and caring for children require tedious, hard labor \u2014 labor that falls almost exclusively to wives, mothers, and daughters.\nIf every community around the globe had the same affordable, reliable, and abundant energy as we enjoy in the United States, the untapped potential of millions of women in developing nations would be unleashed.\nAccess to electricity is the most powerful catalyst for prosperity known to womankind. The overwhelmingly positive influence of energy to the human condition has been proven time and time again by radical advancements in life expectancy, child mortality, maternal mortality, public health, nutrition, economic growth, poverty, income, environmental quality, and nearly every other metric of human flourishing.\nAccording to UNICEF, women and girls around the world spend 200 million hours a day walking to collect water. This is time-consuming and physically taxing work, requiring women to walk more than three miles on average carrying immensely heavy loads while also putting themselves at risk for physical and sexual assault. If a woman was able to fetch the World Health Organization\u2019s recommended supply of daily water for drinking, cooking, and washing, she\u2019d carry 44 pounds of water every day \u2014 per family member.\nThat burden could be lifted with access to electricity to pump the water where it is needed.\nAnd without electricity, that life-sustaining water is a source of danger itself. More than 500,000 people die every year from preventable diseases caused by contaminated water like diarrhea, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio. These needless deaths, nearly unheard of in the developed world, could be prevented with clean water made possible by access to electricity.\nTo make matters worse, three billion people worldwide lack access to safe cooking and heating fuels and are instead forced to burn wood, animal dung, kerosene, or coal. Girls in these households spend more than an hour every day collecting fuel, only to put themselves in more danger when they return home. Sadly, 3.8 million people die prematurely every year as a result of toxic pollutants released when these fuels are burned in closed quarters. Naturally, most are women and girls.\nWe are privileged that electricity is an everyday commodity in the United States, and one we often don\u2019t think twice about as long as the lights turn on when we flick the switch. But electricity could offer so much more than light to women in impoverished countries. It offers the unprecedented opportunity to escape not just physical and financial poverty, but also the poverty of time that too often prevents women from improving their lives.\nA study in Guatemala found that electrification reduced the amount of time women spent cooking by 34 percent, allowing them to invest more time in education, pursuing meaningful work, and civic engagement \u2014 activities that are critical to women\u2019s political and social equality. With better education and meaningful, life-giving work, women in any community have the opportunity to truly shape their futures and their daughters\u2019 futures.\nIn 21st century America, vilifying the oil, natural gas, and coal industries is the politically easy and culturally sophisticated route \u2014 but not the correct route.

Until battery technology achieves unprecedented improvement, renewable energy will remain too unreliable and expensive to make real change in the developing world.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIf every community around the globe had the same affordable, reliable, and abundant energy as we enjoy in the United States, the untapped potential of millions of women in developing nations would be unleashed.

A startling new study has suggested that view is woefully incorrect. Instead, sea levels could rise more than double that amount if global temperatures rise more than expected.\nIf sea levels were to rise by more than two meters (6.5 feet) that the study's authors believe is possible, an event they said \"lies within the 90 percent uncertainty bounds,\" the devastation could be catastrophic. A rise in temperatures by 5 degrees Celsius would cause significant declines in ice levels in Greenland, as well as Antarctica. At the 2 degree Celsius level, Greenland would be the major concern in contributing to the rise in sea levels.\nNEW YORK CITY COULD SEE 'ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME' FLOODS EVERY YEAR 5 YEARS\nFor comparison purposes, a rise of one meter put forth by the 2013 United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report could lead to a loss of land equal in size to France, Germany, Spain and Britain combined and displace more than 180 million people.\n\"A sea-level rise of this magnitude would clearly have profound consequences for humanity,\" the authors of the 2013 report said. The aftermath could severely damage coastal cities such as New York and Miami and the Hawaiian islands in the not-too-distant future.\nGlobal sea-levels have been rising at approximately 3 millimeters per year, according to the new study, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe authors of the new study believe that the 2013 report from the U.N. did not go far enough and only looked at what is \"likely\" to happen and not at the higher probabilities; henceforth, they said it could be construed as misleading for regulators attempting to make decisions.\n\"Limiting attention to the 'likely' range, as was the case in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, may be misleading and will likely lead to a poor evaluation of the true risks,\" said one of the study's authors, Willy Aspinall, in a statement.\nThe new study looks at estimates of what could happen in the 5 to 95 percent range of events, whereas the 2013 U.N. report looked at the 17 to 83 percent range and expects temperatures to rise 2 degrees Celsius.\nWhile a rise of 5 degree Celsius would be considered scientifically unlikely, the study's lead author, Jonathan Bamber, told the BBC that it's important to look at the lower values because there is statistical significance to it.\nHAWAII'S ISLANDS ARE UNDER THREAT FROM RISING SEA LEVELS, EXPERTS WARN\n\"When you start to look at these lower likelihood but still plausible values, then the experts believe that there is a small but statistically significant probability that West Antarctica will transition to a very unstable state and parts of East Antarctica will start contributing as well,\" Bamber told the news outlet. \"But it's only at these higher probabilities for 5C that we see those type of behaviors kicking in.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"}
{"headline": "climate change is hot topic in the european parliament vote", "body": "next Image 1 of 2\nprev Image 2 of 2\nHungry tourists stream into the glass-fronted balcony of Michael Recktenwald's restaurant on the German island of Langeoog, with its splendid view of the North Sea and the blue skies above.\nThe 49-year-old has lived on Langeoog for most of his life, and his wife's family has been there for generations, but Recktenwald fears their children may not be able to stay if the world keeps on warming.\nConcerns about climate change have prompted mass protests across Europe for the past year. For the first time, the issue is expected to have a significant impact on this week's elections for the European Parliament.\nRecktenwald pointed to the damaged levees protecting the island, which is part of the Frisian Archipelago off the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. Islands like Langeoog are among the regions most vulnerable to the rising sea levels predicted to result from climate change.\n\"The sea level has already risen and storm surges are getting more violent,\" he told The Associated Press. \"The chain of dunes is being attacked more strongly, endangering our freshwater supply.\"\nA recent opinion poll in Germany showed that climate change has overtaken immigration as the issue voters in the EU's most populous nation are most concerned about. Elsewhere across the EU, climate change also features prominently among the top issues \u2014 along with immigration and the economy \u2014 ahead of the European Parliament vote that began Thursday and runs through Sunday in all of the bloc's 28 nations.\n\"In many countries, the climate issue has become increasingly one of the top issues that voters are concerned about when they talk about European issues,\" said Derek Beach, a political scientist at the University of Aarhus, Denmark. \"In Denmark, for example, this year it's really almost the only issue that people are talking about in relation to the European Parliament election.\"\nTeenage climate activist Greta Thunberg inspired a 'Fridays for Future' school strikes movement in her native Sweden that's spread across Europe, bringing tens of thousands to the streets demanding faster action on climate change. The Extinction Rebellion direct action group upended traffic across London for days to press the point. Both cite spiking temperature records and dramatic warnings from scientists as reasons to act now to fight global warming.\nYet what remains an abstract threat to most Europeans has become very real to Recktenwald.\n\"We're directly affected,\" he said, walking past beachgoers enjoying the sun from behind the wicker windbreaks that are a signature of German coastal resorts.\nTogether with eight other families elsewhere in the world and a Scandinavian youth group, the Recktenwalds launched a legal action to force the European Union to set more ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A court rejected their case on procedural grounds Wednesday, but the plaintiffs plan to appeal.\nIn the meantime, Recktenwald \u2014 who doesn't belong to any political party \u2014 is hoping that European leaders listen to voters who want their governments and the EU to take decisive action against global warming.\nParties that have traditionally championed environmental causes, such as the Greens in Germany, are well-placed to benefit from the growing concern about climate change. The party clocked an unprecedented 19% support in Germany in a survey published last week, overtaking the center-left Social Democrats that are part of Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition.\n\"We are very optimistic that we will achieve the largest parliamentary group we have ever had in the European Parliament,\" said Ska Keller, one of two leading candidates for the European Greens.\n\"The climate issue is now finally on everyone's lips, a subject that we have been credibly promoting for many decades,\" she added. \"We have very concrete proposals for what we want to do against the climate crisis, for the preservation of biodiversity, for the preservation of our environment.\"\nThe Greens had 52 seats in the last EU legislature, making it fourth biggest political grouping, and are expected to gain more of the European Parliament's 751 total seats.\nOther parties, too, have been waking up to the issue of global warming.\nMerkel's center-right Union bloc has pledged to implement the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to keep average temperatures increases worldwide well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial times. But the party, like many others, has hesitated when it comes to backing tough measures scientists say are necessary to drastically curb greenhouse gas emissions, such as adding a climate tax to fossil fuels.\nIn France, raising gas taxes sparked nationwide protests and created the yellow vest movement for economic justice, whose weekly protests since November, especially in Paris, have often turned violent. That has made other European governments leery of openly backing such a move. Some right-wing parties are attacking the science of global warming in an effort to win voters fearing the economic consequences of combating climate change.\nExperts say the EU as a whole is possibly a better place for making decisions on climate change than its national governments.\n\"This is probably one of the easiest things for most voters to see something that only Europe can deal with,\" said Beach.\nStill, climate change may seem like a luxury issue for voters in struggling economies such as Italy, he said.\n\"When your 20-something kids are both unemployed, then you would definitely perhaps be a little bit more concerned about that kind of economic bread-and butter-issue,\" Beach said.\nUwe Garrels, the mayor of Langeoog, is well aware of the tension between environmental protection and economic prosperity.\nThe island, a half hour's ferry ride from the German mainland, was poor until tourism brought jobs. Now about 1,800 permanent residents and 2,400 seasonal workers look after more than 10,000 visitors during the summer months.\nDespite a drought last year, locals are unwilling to give up their lush lawns for fear of spoiling the island's idyllic image.\nGarrels suggests that Langeoog, a 20-square kilometer (7.7-square mile) island in the heart of a World Heritage site with car-free streets and clean air, can at least help make visitors more environmentally aware.\n\"We can't be viewed in isolation to the entire country or the whole EU,\" he said. \"You can't create an oasis of sustainability on Langeoog if that's not the case in the rest of the country.\"\nRecktenwald, the restaurant owner, hopes the EU election will spur tougher top-down climate action.\n\"If we do nothing,\" he said, \"then my children will probably experience not being able to live here anymore. That's relatively certain.\"\n___\nFor more news from The Associated Press on the European Parliament elections, go to https://www.apnews.com/EuropeanParliament"}

(Previously, the most ambitious plan, adopted by California, aimed to do the same by 2045; critics have pointed out that no one is quite sure how the state will achieve that aggressive goal.)\nBiden\u2019s plan, released Wednesday morning, calls for fossil fuels to be eliminated by 2050, after spending $1.7 trillion in federal funds and $5 trillion in state, local, and private funds. The former vice president also called for building \u201csmall modular nuclear reactors at half the construction cost of today\u2019s reactors\u201d to help replace fossil fuel energy.\nBut 2050 is too late, Ocasio-Cortez said, according to The Hill. \u201cScientifically, anything that is less than helping us cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is going to be too late,\u201d she reportedly said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start, and I think that what that has shown is a dramatic shift in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for a plan that is at the scale of the problem.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez said in January that the world would end in 12 years \u2014 i.e. by 2031 \u2014 if the U.S. did not change its policy radically.

In Australia, he has opposed the building of the Adani coal mine in Queensland.\nAL GORE SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE CAN 'BRING ABOUT THE END OF CIVILIZATION' DURING TALK IN ATLANTA: REPORT\nIt was in that context that the Queensland state government announced last year that Gore would lead a Climate Reality Project training conference in the state from June 5-7.

This is nuts. But I doubt [Adani] is ever going to happen anyway,\" he said, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.\nInstead, he urged Australia to pivot to solar energy and said it would have hard time selling coal to the increasingly solar-reliant India.\n\"Since Australia has the best solar resource of any nation in the world, you would only have to capture 0.1 percent of the solar energy that God makes available to you in order to meet 100 percent of your energy needs,\u201d he said.\nThe climate project was reportedly expected to dovetail with the election of Labor Party prime ministerial hopeful Bill Shorten -- who had campaigned on fighting against climate change. Shorten would have been expected to attend if he had won. But Shorten lost the election last month, with Liberal Party Prime Minister Scott Morrison unexpectedly winning re-election.\nThe Courier-Mail reports that Gore will run the three-day session from Wednesday to Friday, and students as young as 8 will be encouraged to join a \u201cMinister\u2019s Climate Challenge\u201d to help solve the climate crisis."}

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., Green New Deal, many 2020 presidential candidates have released their own proposals to tackle the issue of climate change.\nThe original Green New Deal has been supported by many candidates, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, D-Texas. It has been hailed by the left as a framework for dramatically cutting the United States\u2019 dependence on fossil fuels -- amid a recent report warning of the economic costs climate change would cause in coming years.\nWHAT IS THE GREEN NEW DEAL? A LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC AND CLIMATE CONCEPT PUSHED BY PROGRESSIVES\nBut conservatives have slammed the Green New Deal itself, which could cost as much as $93 trillion, or approximately $600,000 per household, according to a new study co-authored by the former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, as an unworkable and enormously expensive scheme.\nGREEN NEW DEAL ARCHITECT SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE CAN LEAD TO '25 HOLOCAUSTS'\nWhich begs the question -- just where do those Democrats with dreams of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue stand on the issue? Do they support the controversial Green New Deal, and what are their own climate platforms?\nHere\u2019s what some have come up with so far\u2026\nThe 22-page outline released by former Vice President Biden proposes reaching net-zero carbon emissions and achieving 100 percent clean energy by 2050. It calls for an investment of $1.7 trillion of federal funds over the next 10 years, plus private-sector and state and local investments adding up to more than $5 trillion dollars. The money would be paid partially by undoing President Trump\u2019s tax cuts.\nBiden\u2019s plan refers to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, after facing criticism from Democratic presidential rivals about his commitment to environmental protection. Biden has repeatedly insisted his stance is not moderate. In a statement, he pledged to \u201cnot only recommit the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change,\u201d but to \u201cgo much further.\u201d\nFormer President Barack Obama had pledged the U.S. would lower its emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.\nBiden would design \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d programs to help the poor and minorities who would face disproportionate economic harm from pollution. Biden also promised to provide retraining and new economic opportunities for coal, oil, gas, and other industrial workers displaced by the decline of the fossil fuel industry.\nHis most aggressive initiative in the plan is the call to compel other countries\u2014particularly China\u2014to reduce emissions. Biden would aim to combine climate change policy with trade policy using the imposition of \u201ccarbon tariffs\u201d on goods imported from heavily polluting economies.\nHours after the rollout, many noted the similarities between Biden\u2019s plan and the plans of other candidates. Republicans reacted by accusing Biden of the same offense that hampered his presidential campaign in 1988. Tweeting from a state visit to the UK, the president weighed in: \u201cPlagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem, but the Corrupt Media will save him. His other problem is that he is drawing flies, not people, to his Rallies. Nobody is showing up, I mean nobody. You can\u2019t win without people!\u201d\nThe campaign, which had no response when asked by Fox News about the Trump tweet, said earlier on Tuesday that it was a mistake: \"Several citations, some from sources cited in other parts of the plan, were inadvertently left out of the final version of the 22-page document. As soon as we were made aware of it, we updated to include the proper citations.\u201d\nSen. Elizabeth Warren\nOn Tuesday, Warren unveiled a plan to tackle climate change she dubbed the \u201cGreen Manufacturing Deal.\u201d\nHer plan would pump $2 trillion into green jobs and technology innovations in the United States. It would also eliminate the Department of Commerce and several other smaller agencies.\nWarren would pay for her program with proceeds from her proposed new tax on corporate profits and by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. She would also roll back some provisions of the GOP\u2019s 2017 tax law.\nThe plan is part of a new series of policies Warren will continue to roll out that focus on investing in American jobs and innovation.\nThe plan is also meant to emphasize Warren's support for reaching the goals of the Green New Deal. Warren released a plan earlier this month on protecting public lands, which would roll back many of the president\u2019s environmental policies, halt offshore drilling, and restore the original boundary lines for two national monuments.\nMayor Pete Buttigieg supports the Green New Deal as well, but has not released his own plan. In May Buttigieg told \u201cFox News Sunday\u2019s\u201d Chris Wallace, \"What the Green New Deal gets right, is it recognizes that there's also an economic opportunity. Retrofitting buildings means a huge amount of jobs for the building trades in this country.\u201d If the U.S. cannot go carbon-free by 2030, he says he supports going net carbon-free. During a town hall on MSNBC on Monday, Buttigieg told Chris Matthews and an inquisitive eighth grader he would call for a carbon tax, building retrofits, better soil management, and a quadrupling of federal funding for energy and research development.\nLast month, Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee released a plan hailed by Ocasio-Cortez as the \u201cgold standard.\u201d It would meet, and even exceed, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change targets for carbon reduction.\nThe \u201cEvergreen Economy Plan\u201d begins on day one of his administration. By 2030, it aims to reach 100 percent zero emissions from new vehicles, zero carbon pollution from all new commercial and residential buildings and would require total carbon-neutral power across the country.\nBy 2035, it proposes completely clean, renewable and zero-emission energy nationwide.\nIn his 38-page proposal, Inslee seeks to accomplish his plan\u2019s goal through tax incentives for using clean technologies, direct government construction, federal funding of private efforts, regulatory mandates, and use of public land and cooperation with private companies.\nAdditionally, the plan adds more initiatives like green infrastructure and gradual de-carbonization of existing buildings. Inslee promised to raise the minimum wage and protect collective bargaining power for unions, ensure a \"just transition\" and jobs for workers in the fossil fuel industry, and mandate employers follow guidelines for gender pay parity.\nCalling for a $9 trillion investment in green jobs over 10 years, Inslee said his plan would create eight million well-paying jobs for Americans in the transition.\n\"These folks who have worked in the coal industry are deserving of incredible respect and dignity,\" Inslee told ABC News.\n\"They are people whose contributions of multiple generations have literally built the economy of the United States, people who are doing really hard work, and are deserving of our respect and what we've done in the state of Washington, which is to make sure that as we go through this transition, that we also make sure we are caring for and embracing these communities to make sure they have a future as well,\u201d he said.\nO\u2019Rourke announced his own four-pillar plan to combat climate change just days before Governor Inslee.\nThe Texan\u2019s plan labels climate change \u201cthe greatest threat we face.\u201d He plans to invest $5 trillion over 10 years in infrastructure and innovation and set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\nHis emission reduction goal is also in line with the Green New Deal. According to the proposal, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s mobilization would be \u201cdirectly leveraged by a fully paid-for $1.5 trillion investment\u201d and the bill he would introduce to Congress would be funded by \"changes to the tax code to ensure corporations and the wealthiest among us pay their fair share and that we finally end the tens of billions of dollars of tax breaks currently given to fossil fuel companies.\u201d\nO\u2019Rourke also plans to re-enter the Paris agreement on his first day in office and would \"set a first-ever, net-zero emissions by 2030 carbon budget for federal lands, stopping new fossil fuel leases, changing royalties to reflect climate costs, and accelerating renewables development and forestation.\u201d\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\nSen. Booker has released the specifics of what he calls his \u201cenvironment justice plan.\u201d Booker says the proposal would take \"immediate steps\" to strengthen the power of the Environmental Protection Agency.

How do we say no to other candidates in the race who may request debates focused on an issue they\u2019ve made central to their own campaigns?\u201d\nAnd he pointed to other options to spotlight the issue of climate change.\n\u201cAlready, a number of organizations and networks have hosted their own issue-based forums and town halls \u2014 and I hope and expect more of these will take place in the coming months,\u201d Perez emphasized. \u201cNobody is prohibited from participating in a DNC-sanctioned debate because they participated in a climate change forum or town hall.\u201d\nWhile Inslee twice gave Biden a shout-out for joining the calls for a climate change debate, he targeted the former vice president\u2019s efforts on the issue.\nInslee, who last week said that Biden\u2019s new proposal to produce net-zero emissions and reach a 100 percent clean energy economy by 2050 lacks \u201cteeth,\u201d criticized the former vice president again.\n\u201cI am the only candidate who has said this has to be the first priority of the United States. I am the only candidate who has said that. He (Biden) has not,\u201d Inslee told Fox News.\n\u201cI\u2019m the only candidate who has said we have to get off coal with ... teeth in a law in the next ten years. He has not. I\u2019m the only candidate who has said we need to make our transportation system electric in the next decade and a half. He has not,\u201d Inslee spotlighted. \u201cSo there are some differences.\u201d"}

{"headline": "democrats split on china, climate change as biggest threat", "body": "Ten of the dozens of Democrats running for U.S. president in the 2020 election appeared nearly evenly split during Wednesday\u2019s debate in citing climate change or the rogue government of China as the biggest geopolitical threat facing the country today. All failed to mention that those threats are largely one and the same.\nThe Chinese communist regime is systematically eliminating ancient ecosystems in the South China Sea, killing its people with smog, obliterating fertile soil through rare earth mining, and endangering crowded cities with lax regulations on where government-controlled corporations may store dangerous chemicals. It is the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitter and is exporting its environmental apathy worldwide through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a global infrastructure project designed to give China control of how most of the world\u2019s people get from one place to another.\nNo one watching Wednesday night\u2019s debate \u2013 hosted by NBC News, MSNBC, and Telemundo \u2013 would have heard any of the candidates condemn China\u2019s reckless activities or note in their warnings about climate change that, without regime change in China, humanity will fail to rescue its damaged environment. The absence of this reality in the debate is made all the starker by candidates discussing China and climate change as two separate topics within seconds of each other.\nTowards the end of the night, moderator Chuck Todd asked each of the ten candidates on stage what they believed the \u201cgreatest geopolitical threat\u201d to the United States was. Former Rep. John Delaney (D-MD) named China as the biggest \u201cchallenge\u201d and \u201cnuclear weapons\u201d on their own as the biggest \u201cthreat.\u201d Joining him in naming China were Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH). The other most popular answer was \u201cclimate change,\u201d the preferred threat cited by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), former Rep. Robert \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke (D-TX), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ).\nRep. Juli\u00e1n Castro (D-TX) got away with naming both, without identifying the relationship between the two:\nChina regularly escapes blame for its role in destroying the global environment because it is a party to the Paris climate agreement, and the Communist Party regularly chastises the world for not doing enough to keep the earth clean and alive. Yet no government is doing more harm to its environment \u2013 and exporting environmental destruction \u2013 than Beijing.\nChina\u2019s prodigious contributions to the destruction of the earth have grown exponentially during Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping\u2019s tenure, almost proportionally to the number of Chinese government statements condemning other countries for polluting the earth. China broke air pollution levels in 2015, allowing the quality of its air to reach 50 times the World Health Organization maximum levels for pollutants at the time. A year later, environmental scientists published a report finding that China is responsible for ten percent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and had tripled carbon dioxide emissions in three decades. In October, Chinese University of Hong Kong researchers published a study finding that one million Chinese people a year are dying as a result of air pollution; pollution is also, the study found, killing 20 million tons of crops and costing the country nearly $38 million a year.\nIn May, scientists studying illegal ozone-destroying chemicals found a significant increase in global levels of trichlorofluoromethane, a toxic chlorofluorocarbon, and traced most of it back to two provinces in China. This pollution does not stay in China; American scientists have found it increasingly present on the U.S. West Coast.\nOn the ground, China\u2019s dominance of rare earth mining \u2013 the retrieval of lucrative elements used in the construction of smartphones and other consumer technology \u2013 is destroying entire Chinese communities by contaminating water supplies and rendering soil sterile.\n\u201cProcessing rare earths is a dirty business,\u201d the Guardian detailed in 2014, adding:\nTheir ore is often laced with radioactive materials such as thorium, and separating the wheat from the chaff requires huge amounts of carcinogenic toxins \u2013 sulphates, ammonia and hydrochloric acid. Processing one ton of rare earths produces 2,000 tons of toxic waste; Baotou\u2019s rare earths enterprises produce 10m tons of wastewater per year.\nChina\u2019s illegal colonization of the South China Sea \u2013 which it should legally be sharing with Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, and Malaysia \u2013 has destroyed at least 17 reefs in the Spratly Island region, once one of the world\u2019s most fertile fishing grounds, and decimating local fish populations. China has built multiple artificial islands in the Spratly and Paracel Island chains \u2013 which legally belong to the Philippines and Vietnam \u2013 and equipped them with military and surveillance assets. The dredging needed to build these islands have caused environmental damage that \u201cis substantial and unprecedented in scale,\u201d marine biologist Terry Hughes said in 2015. A BBC report a year later found that China is also intentionally destroying fishing populations to harm its neighbors, not merely overfishing them out of existence.\nChina has exported its disregard for nature through its Belt and Road Initiative. The BRI seeks to give China control of the world\u2019s largest roads, ports, and railways by signing construction agreements with developing nations that require predatory loans, to be paid later with the property China built with the money. BRI projects are underway in Southeast Asia, Subsaharan Africa, and parts of Europe. China aspires to bring these projects into Latin America and, ultimately, the United States.\nThe World Wildlife Fund estimates that as many as 265 threatened animal species will be \u201cdirectly impacted\u201d by Belt and Road.\n\u201cWWF is concerned that BRI-related investments, including infrastructure development, may result in a unique set of challenges to sustainable development, if they are not properly planned and implemented,\u201d the NGO wrote in a 2017 report.\nChina has taken measures to protect its international reputation from the damage that its outsized role in exacerbating environmental destruction should inflict. Local Communist Party cadres fabricate environmental statistics to give the appearance of abiding by international standards. (To keep up the illusion, the national Party sometimes punishes its underlings for \u201ccorruption.\u201d) Beijing has forced rural peasants to endure harsh winters without burning coal to keep warm, threatening the lives of their children while the families of Party leaders in Shanghai and Beijing lived comfortably.\nPerhaps most importantly, China goes out of its way to censor critics of its environmental protection on the Internet. In 2015, when a giant cache of illegally stockpiled chemicals exploded in Tianjin, a city of 15 million, China censored 50 websites for \u201ccreating panic\u201d by reporting on the scope of the disaster.\nNone of these concerns surfaced in Wednesday\u2019s debate, even as the issues of environmental destruction and China\u2019s threat to the world were brought up within seconds of each other. Democrats have a political reason to maintain their silence on this: President Donald Trump is the world\u2019s loudest voice warning about Chinese Communist Party threats to the world, and some Democrats, perhaps to spite him, have openly embraced China\u2019s environmental destruction. But without addressing the reality that saving the planet from climate change is impossible as long as the Chinese Communist Party remains in power, the Democrats\u2019 environmental concerns come off as disingenuous and unreliable to measure if the candidates will take material steps in office to protect the earth.\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter."}

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) calls the \u201croot causes\u201d of the migration.\nNext, Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 echoing presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2014 demands action on climate change and the implementation of her \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d which she says will reduce the flow of \u201crefugees.\u201d\nFollowing that, Ocasio-Cortez calls for decriminalizing illegal border crossings, making illegal immigration a \u201ccivil\u201d matter.\nFinally, she calls for massive spending by the government to stimulate the economy \u2014 though the U.S. economy is already growing quickly, and is at the lowest unemployment levels in nearly half a century.\nA thread of some of the policy approaches we should consider wrt immigration: 1. Foreign policy: Reinstate US humanitarian aid in the Northern Triangle, where people are fleeing. US should start acting like a real partner in Latin America,& increase visas where we intervene. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 3, 2019\n2. Climate change: There is broad consensus from military to activists that resource strains (droughts, famine, etc) & nat disasters are drivers of refugees. People are fleeing places that were once livable &are no longer. It will get worse the longer we do nothing #GreenNewDeal \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 3, 2019\n3. Border policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it\u2019s time to repeal Section 1325 & 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code & into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 3, 2019\n4. Econ: We need large-scale public investment to spur job creation for citizens&immigrants alike. Ideally that investment transitions us to a sustainable economy (climate & income-wise).

{"headline": "liberty vittert: climate change alarmists deny science in misrepresenting june's heatwave", "body": "There is no doubt that climate change is an issue that needs to be discussed and addressed. But alarmist headlines and personal agendas only give climate change deniers more ammunition in the fight against real science that tells us we need to pay attention to climate change.\nIn response to a report from a European Satellite Agency, everyone from CNN to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is howling from the rooftops about June being \"the hottest month ever recorded on Earth.\"\nThe report has been interpreted to show that the global average temperature this June was about 0.18 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the previous record set in June 2016.\nDANIEL TURNER: DECADES AGO, THE UN PROMISED CLIMATE DISASTER; SO WHY HASN'T IT ARRIVED?\nAccording to the same headlines and tweets, experts say that climate change is to blame.\nLet\u2019s take a look.\nFirst, many have mistakenly called it the hottest month ever recorded. What the report actually said is that it was the hottest June ever recorded, not the hottest month.\nSecond, technically speaking, yes, it is the hottest June \"ever recorded.\" But recordings are only officially recognized back to the 1880s.\nDuring the Hadean period billions of years ago, Earth had a surface temperature of 450 degrees Fahrenheit. We do not have enough reliable data from historical times, and we simply don\u2019t know what the temperatures were to the level of precision we have today.\nThat still leaves us with the thought that this June was the hottest in the past 139 years. Is that true?\nMaybe.\nWhether 2017 was warmer or cooler than 2015, or 2014 or 2013 really doesn\u2019t prove anything. The only way to see a pattern is to look at long-term temperature changes spanning hundreds of years, along with many other measurements.\nWhen average global temperatures are taken, there is always a margin of error on the measurement. It is impossible to find the one true value. There is always a plus or minus associated with the finding (and sometimes the plus or minus is greater than the alleged increase or decrease).\nFor instance, an old NASA press release projected that 2015 would be the hottest year ever. The agency predicted it would break the record by .02 degrees Celsius. However, the margin of error was plus or minus 0.1 degrees Celsius, larger than the projected increase.\nIn other words, they had no idea what was going to happen.\nNow, after a significant amount of searching, I couldn\u2019t find the statistical details of this on the Copernicus Climate Change Service\u2019s (European Commission) website (where the official statement of June\u2019s heat wave came from), but I can promise you, there is a plus or minus attached to the 0.18 increase.\nLet\u2019s give these measurements the benefit of the doubt and say that this June was .18 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the previous hottest June. Even if true, it is basically irrelevant to decision-making.\nVariation is the spice of life, and it exists abundantly in nature. Whether 2017 was warmer or cooler than 2015, or 2014 or 2013 really doesn\u2019t prove anything. The only way to see a pattern is to look at long-term temperature changes spanning hundreds of years, along with many other measurements.\nYes, the trend is warming. Yes, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and we know its concentration has increased drastically since the industrial revolution. Yes, we know it is harmful.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBut if we are so desperate to get our points across that we embrace alarmism, we demean the real science that tells us that we do need to pay attention to the environment, and we inevitably give climate change deniers enormous ammunition.\nClimate change zealots vilify climate change deniers for denying science. Unfortunately, much of the time, they do exactly the same.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LIBERTY VITTERT"}

Thanks to @washingtonpost for co-publishing https://t.co/dQQKvLSA8p \u2014 Caroline Preston (@cpreston) July 7, 2019\nThe article focuses on a school in Oklahoma, where many students have parents who have good jobs in the flourishing oil and gas industry in the state, that promotes environmentalists\u2019 belief that fossil fuels are the main culprit causing climate change.\nMelissa Lau is a sixth-grade teacher in the classroom profiled in the reporter\u2019s story, which was documented before the start of summer vacation. According to the report:\nMs. Lau, 42, has taught science for seven years at Piedmont Intermediate School, which is housed in an airy, modern building overlooking a wheat field and serves predominantly middle-class families, many of whom work in the oil and gas industry. For much of that time, she has sought to acquaint students with the basics of the planet\u2019s warming. On this next-to-last week of the school year, she was squeezing in a lesson exploring the link between increased carbon emissions and extreme weather events such as floods and hurricanes.\nThe article cites the \u201cpolitics\u201d in \u201cruby-red Oklahoma\u201d and notes that teachers do get questions and \u201cpushback\u201d from parents over climate change lessons.\nAnd it claims the oil and gas industry funds the promotion of fossil fuels in the schools and accuses lawmakers in the state of introducing legislation that \u201ccritics say would encourage teachers to spread misinformation on evolution and climate change.\u201d\n\u201cEvery year, we have to fight one or two bills,\u201d said Lau, who was wearing a denim jacket and a \u201cI teach climate change\u201d button, according to the article. \u201cI don\u2019t get the resistance I got at the beginning of my career because it\u2019s getting harder and harder to deny.\u201d\nOn this particular day, the teacher showed the students a video that made an analogy between sports doping and climate change.\n\u201cSteroids can make it easier for players to hit home runs,\u201d the video explained. \u201cBut it\u2019s impossible to know if any single home run is due to doping.\u201d\n\u201cSo to assess the effects of the drugs, one has to observe a player\u2019s performance over time. Same with climate change: Some extreme weather events occur regardless of whether humans are pumping extra carbon into the atmosphere.\u201d\n\u201cScientists can determine if these emissions are affecting the climate only by following patterns over time,\u201d the video continued.\nThe article explains that in 2013, teaching climate change in schools got a \u201cboost\u201d when states could incorporate the Next Generation Science Standards into their curriculum, which includes introducing children to climate change and its human causes, starting in middle school.\n\u201cTo date, 20 states plus the District of Columbia have adopted the standards, and many other states have embraced a modified version,\u201d the article says.\nAt least one science education advocate confirms the lack of training teachers have to teach climate change.\n\u201cClimate and earth sciences more generally have been historically neglected in American science education,\u201d said Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education, a group devoted to tracking down \u201canti-science education legislation.\u201d\n\u201cLots of teachers feel they don\u2019t have the content knowledge or pedagogical know-how to teach climate change effectively,\u201d Branch said in the article.\nAnd while Lau said she wants her students to have \u201chope\u201d about the future, they sound less than hopeful in the article.\n\u201cNow that I know more about the facts of climate change, it\u2019s a little bit easier to believe,\u201d student Jewel Horn said. \u201cIt feels like more of a threat.\u201d\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m thinking that we\u2019re in a crisis,\u201d Horn\u2019s classmate Dan Nguyen said, adding that he was a \u201clittle angry\u201d because people \u201cshould be more careful of what they are doing, what they are using.\u201d\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter"}
{"headline": "want to fight climate change? plant 1 trillion trees.", "body": "Want to help save the world from climate change? Then grab some seeds, or some seedlings, and start planting trees like there's no tomorrow.\nAt least 1 trillion of them, and fast.\nThat may sound like a lot of trees, but the Earth has room for their gnarled bows and branches. In a new study that excluded cities and agricultural areas, researchers found that the planet has nearly 3.5 million square miles (9 million square kilometers) to spare for trees. Such newly planted trees could cut carbon (a part of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere by nearly 25%, bringing it down to levels not seen for nearly 100 years, the scientists said. [Image Gallery: A Rainbow of Fall Leaves]\nThe study shows where in the world these trees could be planted, and how much carbon they could store. (Trees take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it in a process called photosynthesis, which allows them to grow, ultimately storing that carbon in their leaves and other parts.) Russia has the most space at 583,000 square miles (1.5 million square km), followed by the United States at 397,700 square miles (1 million square km), the researchers found. The next top contenders are Canada with 302,700 square miles (784,000 square km), Australia with 223,900 square miles (578,900 square km), Brazil with 191,900 square miles (497,000 square km), and China with 155,200 square miles (402,000 square km) available for new green shoots.\nIn all, this area is equal to about the size of the United States.\n\"We all knew restoring forests could play a part in tackling climate change, but we had no scientific understanding of what impact this could make,\" study senior author Thomas Crowther, an assistant professor of ecology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich (ETH Zurich), said in a statement.\nThe team's calculation \"shows clearly that forest restoration is the best climate change solution available today,\" Crowther added.\nPlanting trees in these regions would increase Earth's forest-covered land by a third, all without affecting land humans use for cities and agriculture. Once these trees have matured, they could store 225 billion tons (205 billion metric tons) of carbon, or about two-thirds of the 330 billion tons (300 billion metric tons) of carbon that humans have released into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution began.\nThe unfolding greenery could help limit Earth's warming climate. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report found that adding an additional 3.8 million square miles (10 million square km) of forestland could limit climate change to 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) by 2050. But this number may change, as climate change factors tend to accelerate quickly, meaning that even more trees than the IPCC calculated in their report may be needed to achieve that goal, the researchers said.\nThe Swiss team came up with their forecasts by using a dataset of nearly 80,000 forests and combining that with Google Earth Engine, which allowed them to make a predictive model of tree cover.\nHowever, even if the trees are planted pronto, their effects won't be immediate.\n\"It will take decades for new forests to mature and achieve this potential,\" Crowther said. \"It is vitally important that we protect the forests that exist today, pursue other climate solutions and continue to phase out fossil fuels from our economies in order to avoid dangerous climate change.\"\nThe study was published online yesterday (July 4) in the journal Science.\nOriginally published on Live Science."}

{"headline": "delingpole: my solution to climate change? eat prince charles", "body": "The Prince of Wales has warned global leaders that if we don\u2019t tackle climate change in 18 months the human race will go extinct.\nNo, really. Here are his actual words, in a speech in London yesterday to foreign ministers from the Commonwealth.\nI am firmly of the view that the next 18 months will decide our ability to keep climate change to survivable levels and to restore nature to the equilibrium we need for our survival.\nOK. So assuming, for a moment, that the Prince of Wales isn\u2019t just spouting gibberish, what kind of measures might we need to adopt in the next 18 months to \u201ckeep climate change to survivable levels\u201d?\nHappily, we have a good idea courtesy of Lord Deben, chairman of the government\u2019s Climate Change Committee. Writing in the Prince of Wales\u2019s favourite magazine Country Life, he says:\nIt simply demands that we live more sustainably \u2013 that we stop wasting water, become really energy efficient, cut food waste, eat 20 percent less meat, take all our energy from renewable sources and ensure our homes are properly insulated and ventilated.\nThat word \u201csimply\u201d is doing a lot of work there.\nIf you\u2019re a carnivore like me, for example, you might not take too kindly to the notion that some dodgy peer who has made at least part of his fortune by promulgating green hysteria has the right to issue directives on how many bacon sarnies or burgers you can reasonably consume per week.\nBut I have an even bigger red flag waving over that glib suggestion that we should \u201ctake all our energy from renewable sources\u201d.\nAll of it? Really??\nThe late Professor David Mackay, a Cambridge engineer and chief scientist at the UK government\u2019s Department of Energy and Climate Change once looked at what decarbonising the economy by going 100 per cent renewable might look like for the British landscape. Needless to say, it wasn\u2019t pretty.\nIt would involve:\nBuilding 61,000 wind turbines. Covering 5 per cent of the UK landmass \u2014 the equivalent of Cambridgeshire, Gloucestershire, Lancashire, and Staffordshire combined \u2014 with solar arrays. (That would be 100 x more solar PV than his been installed in the whole world to date.) Damming most of the rivers in the West Highlands of Scotland to generate hydropower. Building huge barrages across rivers such as the Severn, destroying intertidal mud flats and devastating bird and fish species. Using the entirety of Britain\u2019s agricultural land to grow biofuels.\nDavid Mackay was by no means a climate change sceptic. But he was honest enough a scientist to be able to tell his government employers what they didn\u2019t want to hear: that the idea that the UK could power itself by 100 per cent renewable energy was an \u201cappalling delusion\u201d.\nThough it\u2019s claimed that 14 per cent of the world\u2019s energy is renewable, this is misleading. The majority of this \u2014 three quarters \u2014 comes from burning what is euphemistically called \u2018biomass\u201d \u2014 most of it what you and I call wood.\nIn other words the environmental movement is claiming as a triumph something that actually is a disaster: millions of people in the Third World are still reliant on the same inefficient, environmentally destructive, health-damaging energy technology that was used by cavemen.\nAs for wind turbines \u2014 ugly and seemingly ubiquitous a nuisance though they are \u2014 these currently provide less than one per cent of global energy.\nGlobal energy demand, meanwhile, has been growing at about two per cent per year for the last 40 years. So, just to provide sufficient wind power to cover that increase in demand, how many wind turbines would need to be built?\nMatt Ridley answers that question here:\nIf wind turbines were to supply all of that growth but no more, how many would need to be built each year? The answer is nearly 350,000, since a two-megawatt turbine can produce about 0.005 terawatt-hours per annum. That\u2019s one-and-a-half times as many as have been built in the world since governments started pouring consumer funds into this so-called industry in the early 2000s. At a density of, very roughly, 50 acres per megawatt, typical for wind farms, that many turbines would require a land area [half the size of] the British Isles, including Ireland. Every year. If we kept this up for 50 years, we would have covered every square mile of a land area [half] the size of Russia with wind farms. Remember, this would be just to fulfil the new demand for energy, not to displace the vast existing supply of energy from fossil fuels, which currently supply 80 per cent of global energy needs.\nApart from the obvious visual blight, the environmental cost of building so many wind turbines would be enormous.\nAs Andrew Montford notes in a report for the Global Warming Policy Foundation called Green Killing Machines, nothing damages the environment quite like a wind farm.\nThe impact on bats is thought to be particularly serious, with turbines causing pressure waves that make their lungs implode. One recent study raised the possibility that whole populations of some bat species might be threatened. Birds, and particularly raptors, may collide with turbines: direct collision might cause 20 avian fatalities per turbine per year although considerably higher numbers have been mooted.\nBy coincidence, yesterday I found myself driving past the Prince of Wales\u2019s country house near Tetbury in the Cotswolds, a strong competitor for the most beautiful area of England.\nI drove through valley after valley of idyllic, unspoiled countryside, interrupted only by the occasional chocolate box village of honey-coloured stone with ducks and moorhens being photographed by Chinese tourists who clearly couldn\u2019t believe somewhere quite so perfect-looking could actually exist.\nThis is the kind of place where you choose to live if, like the Prince of Wales, you are very, very rich. His net worth has been estimated at around $400 million \u2014 not unusual for a climate change alarmist.\nFrom multimillionaire Leo Di Caprio to multimillionaire Al Gore, multimillionaire Sir David Attenborough to multimillionaire Tom Steyer, from multimillionaire Sir Richard Branson to multimillionaire Emma Thompson, environmentalism is a hugely attractive religion which enables you to achieve two perfectly wonderful things simultaneously.\nFirst, it enables you to parade your moral virtue by showing that even though you are disgustingly rich you are still in fact an incredibly caring person.\nSecond, it means you can lecture the revolting lower orders on how they should live their lives and you can campaign to make everything more expensive and miserable for them, as Sir David Attenborough did earlier this week when he urged that air tickets should be hiked up. Obviously, people like Attenborough will go on flying regardless because they\u2019ll still be able to afford it whatever environmental levies are imposed. But stopping other people from doing it will mean that airports and holiday destinations will be less crowded, just as Mother Gaia intended.\nAnyway, as I drove through Prince of Wales country, marvelling at the deliciousness of the views, I wondered how many of the people living on the gorgeous private estates in which the Cotswolds abounds share Prince Charles\u2019s views on the environment. Quite a few I suspect. I know of one super-rich hedge fund manager who has donated to Extinction Rebellion, for example, which strikes me as a classic example of the cognitive dissonance to which the super-rich seem prey. On the one hand they are clever enough and, presumably, capable of sufficient due diligence to have been able to have made vast fortunes; on the other, all their powers of discernment, intelligence and research appear to have left them when it comes to the issue of climate change.\nHow are we going to get it into their thick, overprivileged heads that the Net Zero carbon dioxide by 2050 targets for which they are so passionately advocating will destroy everything they hold dear?\nThey\u2019ll only learn, I think, when they finally get what it is they\u2019ve been asking for:\nPiles of shredded raptors landing with a thud on the estates around Balmoral, sliced and diced by wind turbines. Solar farms and wind farms obliterating every last stretch of the Cotswolds. Wading birds driven forever out of the Severn Estuary by a tidal barrier. Their cleaning ladies, gardeners, and grooms turning up to work in tears because their parents have just frozen to death in fuel poverty.\nThey won\u2019t like it. But by then it will be far too late."}

{"headline": "today's climate change is worse than anything earth has experienced in the past 2,000 years", "body": "The global climate is changing faster now than it has at any point in the past 2,000 years.\nThat's the conclusion of a trio of papers published July 24 in the journals Nature and Nature Geoscience that examined the global climate over the past two millennia. The researchers showed that none of the past fluctuations \u2014 that is, not the Little Ice Age, the warm period known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly or any other famous shift \u2014 had the global reach that modern climate change is having. Past fluctuations tended to be localized, affecting primarily one region at a time. Modern climate change, by contrast, is messing with the entire world.\n\"Temperatures did not rise and fall everywhere in step [in the past],\" editors wrote in an accompanying opinion piece in Nature Geoscience. \"Specifically, early cool or warm intervals that lasted for centuries peaked at different times in different regions.\"\nThat's a radical departure from modern climate change, Scott St. George, a climate researcher at the University of Minnesota who wasn't involved in the research, wrote in a news and views article for Nature. [10 Climate Myths Busted]\n\"Although the Little Ice Age was the coldest epoch of the past millennium, the timing of the lowest temperatures varied from place to place,\" St. George wrote. \"Two-fifths of the planet were subjected to the coldest weather during the mid-nineteenth century, but the deepest chill occurred several centuries earlier in other regions. And even at the height of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, only 40% of Earth\"s surface reached peak temperatures at the same time. Using the same metrics, global warming today is unparalleled: for 98% of the planet's surface, the warmest period of the Common Era occurred in the late twentieth century.\"\nThat means that almost every part of the planet had its hottest decades in the past 2,000 years at the same time.\nAnd the 21st century, which is outside the scope of these papers, has been much hotter than the 20th century so far. In fact, the world is on track to keep warming as greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere.\nTo develop a rigorous picture of global temperatures over the past 2,000 years, the researchers relied on nearly 700 records from the so-called PAGES 2k proxy temperature database. That database rounds up evidence from ice cores, trees, coral and other substances that change their appearance or chemical composition based on global temperatures. The researchers used those records to build a detailed map of climate fluctuations the world over. And none of them look like the consistent, persistent shifts we're seeing today.\nOf course, the causes are different, too. Evidence from the previous 2,000 years shows that short-lived volcanic events were the main drivers of climate fluctuations, the authors wrote. Human activities were perhaps a very minor secondary factor over that period. Now, humans are the ones driving the bus. And this time, it's headed toward the edge of a cliff.\nOriginally published on Live Science."}

And hundreds of reindeer carcasses showed signs of starvation, Norway's national news outlet, NRK, reported on July 27. [6 Surprising Facts About Reindeer]\n\"It's scary to find so many dead animals,\" \u00c5shild \u00d8nvik Pedersen, an NPI terrestrial ecologist, told NRK. Reindeer in Svalbard are a subspecies, Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus, and they are short-legged, with endearingly small, rounded heads. Males are slightly larger than females, measuring about 5 feet (1.6 meters) long and weighing up to 198 lbs. (90 kilograms), according to NPI.\nClimate change is bringing warmer temperatures to Svalbard, which means more precipitation. And heavy rainfall in December is thought to be responsible for the unusually high number of reindeer deaths, the researchers wrote on May 28 on the NPI website.\nAfter the December rain hit the ground, the precipitation froze, creating \"tundra ice caps,\" a thick layer of ice that prevented reindeer from reaching vegetation in their usual winter grazing pastures. This forced the animals to dig pits in shoreline snow to find seaweed and kelp, which are less nutritious than the reindeer's usual fare.\nThe scientists also observed reindeer grazing on cliffs, which the animals rarely do during winters when food is more plentiful. Rocky, mountainous regions on Svalbard don't have much plant life, and this \"mountain goat strategy\" is risky for the reindeer, because the cliffs are very steep. But during lean years, about 50% of the reindeer climb to altitudes of nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) in a desperate search for food, the researchers reported.\nWith their pastures locked in ice, the reindeer also have to travel farther to find food. And when there is little to eat, the youngest and oldest animals are usually the first to die, Pedersen told NRK.\n\"Some of the mortality is natural because there were so many calves last year,\" she said. \"But the large number we see now is due to heavy rainfall, which is due to global warming.\"\nOriginally published on Live Science."}

During this period, Germany produced 3.9 million tons of meat, led by pork, the primary ingredient in German sausages.\n\u201cI favor abolishing the VAT reduction for meat and using it (the increased revenues) instead for more animal welfare,\u201d said Greens agriculture spokesman, Friedrich Ostendorff.\nThe idea of raising meat taxes would be to reduce livestock numbers \u2014 as well as their gaseous output \u2014 by discouraging people from eating meat.\nLast June, Germany\u2019s Green party vowed to ban industrial farming to reduce global warming if it ever were to come to power.\nThe measure was proposed by Katrin Goering-Eckardt, the party\u2019s leader in the Germany parliament, as part of a massive \u20ac100 billion project to finance climate initiatives.\nEven prior to this, in 2013, the Green party had sought to launch a weekly, meatless \u201cveggie day,\u201d a project that reportedly failed to garner much support from ordinary citizens.\nRecalling this fiasco, Christian Lindner, the leader of the pro-business Free Democrats, warned last June that the Greens \u201cdream of a meat-less country.\u201d\n\u201cWhoever wants to be vegan is free to do so, but the rest of us shouldn\u2019t be banned from eating our schnitzel,\u201d Mr Lindner said.\nGermany is not alone in proposing meat tax hikes to combat global warming.\nIn March of 2018, a New York Times op-ed put forward the idea of a special tax on the beef industry to compensate for the alleged damage Big Beef has caused to the environment by provoking climate change.\nIn his article titled \u201cThe Case for a Carbon Tax on Beef,\u201d Richard Conniff contended that it is time to break off \u201cour collective love affair with beef\u201d because the cattle industry \u201chas a larger impact on the environment than that of any other meat or dairy product.\u201d\nMr. Conniff in turn confessed that he got the idea for a special beef tax from the French, which is unsurprising to those who follow the way the French tend to solve their problems.\nIn May 2018, former President Barack Obama warned the world that meat consumption was causing a dramatic rise in dangerous greenhouse gas emissions.\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t as familiar with the impact of cows and methane,\u201d Obama said at a food innovation summit in Milan, adding that \u201cas people want to increase more meat consumption, that in turn is spiking the growth of greenhouse emissions coming out of the agricultural sector.\u201d\nThe growing demand for beef as people get wealthier is contributing to global warming, Obama said, alluding to the amounts of methane gas emitted by cow herds.\n\u201cNo matter what, we are going to see an increase in meat consumption,\u201d Obama said, pointing to developing economies in China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. More advanced countries, Obama said, would have to teach people to \u201chave a smaller steak\u201d and explore ways to diminish their meat intake.\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome"}

The economies of these countries would decline 10 percent, 12 percent and 9 percent, respectively.\nAlthough the researchers acknowledge that world economies will change and adapt to the shifting climate, it may not be enough. According to scientific consensus, it takes roughly 30 years to adapt to climate change, from altering infrastructure to cultural practices. But if that timeframe were sped up to 20 years, the U.S. would still lose 7 percent of its GDP by the end of the century.\n\"The U.K. recently had its hottest day on record. Train tracks buckled, roads melted, and thousands were stranded because it was out of the norm,\" Mohaddes said. \"Such events take an economic toll, and will only become more frequent and severe without policies to address the threats of climate change.\"\nAlthough the report may seem dour about the prospects of the global economy, not all hope is lost, especially if countries abide by the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.

The third of that series is set for Sept. 12 and potentially Sept. 13 if enough candidates qualify.\nPerez has argued that he wants the broadest audiences possible to see Democratic candidates discuss a wide range of issues.

That could, however, meet Perez's definition of a \"debate,\" and thus run afoul of existing rules barring candidates from such events not sanctioned by the party.\nIn a statement, Sunrise Movement called the day a \"partial victory for young climate organizers nationwide,\" because \"after months of campaigning,\" the resolutions committee had reversed a ban on presidential candidates participating side-by-side in \"non-DNC sanctioned events to discuss the climate crisis.\"\nBERKELEY SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE EMERGENCY IS BASICALLY JUST LIKE WORLD WAR II\nBut activists have long sought an official DNC-sanctioned climate-change debate.

In the aftermath of the election, some blamed her for Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss, pointing out that in the critical swing states of Michigan and Wisconsin, Trump\u2019s margin of victory was less than the number of votes won by Stein.\nSince 2016, the climate issue has taken center stage in Democrats\u2019 platforms, becoming especially important to young voters who are playing a growing role in our elections. A Pew Center survey reports that voters under the age of 53 cast 62.2 million votes in the 2018 midterm elections, more than the 60.1 million recorded by people 53 and older. In the midterm contest, Gen Z and millennials made up 25 percent of the total votes cast; their share will increase in 2020.\nYoung voters are energized, and especially about global warming. A Harvard Kennedy School survey found climate change to be the third most important issue to voters under 30, behind immigration and the economy.\nThe decision to prevent a climate debate will almost certainly encourage a third-party candidate. And that candidate could sabotage Democrats\u2019 chances of retaking the White House.\nFor proof of the importance of young climate enthusiasts, look no further than the Sunrise Movement, an activist group begun only two years ago that has attracted tens of thousands of followers and staged protests in 250 cities around the country. It also takes credit for launching the Green New Deal, which, though widely mocked on the right, has been embraced by nearly every Democratic senator running for 2020.\nSunrise representatives in attendance at the San Francisco convention erupted after the DNC vote to block a climate debate, chanting \u201cFailure of leadership\u201d and \u201cwe can\u2019t wait\u201d to protest the complicity of DNC Chair Tom Perez in the decision; many stormed out of the meeting.\nTheir anger was echoed on social media.\nElizabeth Warren tweeted: \u201cClimate change is an existential threat that threatens (sic) all of us\u2026.That\u2019s why we need to have a #ClimateDebate.\u201d\nAl Gore chimed in, tweeting: \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 decision to sabotage a #ClimateDebate is extremely disappointing.

{"headline": "no issue 'more important than climate change\u2019", "body": "Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has not remained silent since leaving the powerful post he held, including advising several of the 2020 Democrat presidential hopefuls, writing op-eds, and granting interviews with the media.\nIn the New York Times, he wrote about getting rid of the filibuster rule in the Senate that he helped install, claiming in today\u2019s political climate nothing can get done. Reid said the filibuster helped him advance President Barack Obama\u2019s agenda.\nBut in an interview with National Public Radio (NPR) Reid said that the most pressing issue the country faces, and that Congress needs to address, is climate change.\n\u201cI think we need to take a very close look at getting rid of the filibuster, period,\u201d Reid said, which led to NPR\u2019s host of Weekend Edition Sunday to ask, \u201cDoesn\u2019t that create a situation where one party gets to railroad the other party depending on who is in charge of that upper chamber?\u201d\nReid said that without the filibuster a majority, instead of 60 votes, could make things happen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important, because let\u2019s take some major issues the country faces,\u201d Reid said. \u201cNo issue in my mind is more important than climate change.\u201d\n\u201cIt is devastating our world,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThe United States must be a leader in this.\u201d\n\u201cBut with Trump and basically Republicans saying that climate change doesn\u2019t exist, we\u2019re getting nothing done, I mean nothing, we don\u2019t have a lot of time to spare,\u201d Reid said.\nThe introduction of Reid\u2019s profile isn\u2019t completely flattering. According to NPR:\nHe had a reputation for being a tough politician who did what was necessary to get what he thought needed to be done, done. Even if sometimes that meant calling his opponents names, changing rules or, pushing the narrative that Mitt Romney didn\u2019t pay taxes without furnishing any evidence to back up the claim.\nReid, 79, is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer but told NPR his prognosis is good.\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter"}
